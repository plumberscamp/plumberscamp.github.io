<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod, gently lift the rod and listen. If the water shuts off, you may be able to stop the running by adjusting the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float adjustment screw on top (see Figure A below). Flex the float arm if there is no modification screw. Make sure it's changed correctly (Image 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You don't need to empty the tank to make these adjustments.</p>
