<p>Often, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces data on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to understand what the field test data suggests for that specific assembly.  When a skilled tester translates the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
