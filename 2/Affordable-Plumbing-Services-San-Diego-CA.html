<p>Waste Disposal Unit Installation Fed Up With False Promises? Water circulates in the tank where small resin beads swap the calcium and magnesium in the water for the salt or potassium they're holding. The beads serve as a sponge, adsorbing the firmness minerals from your water. This process is described as ion exchange, and soft water is the outcome. When the resin beads have maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a process called regeneration). During this procedure, the resin beads are washed with the extremely focused saltwater option (brine) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank). The brine requires the calcium and magnesium ions to be released from the beads and changed with sodium or potassium ions.</p>
