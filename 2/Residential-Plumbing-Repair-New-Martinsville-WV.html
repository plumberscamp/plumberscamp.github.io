<p>Leak detection belongs of water conservation that depends on extremely technical expertise and specialized devices to recognize the place of leakages throughout the city's water circulation system and determine the place of those leaks at which noticeable water might or might not have actually surfaced.

The closer the device is to that 8 to 12-year limitation, the more skeptical the economics of a repair becomes. The reason is that some other part on the device will go or its tank will leak. And there's no remedy for a leaking tank.</p>
