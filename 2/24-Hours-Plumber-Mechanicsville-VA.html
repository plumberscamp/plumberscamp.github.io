<p>A partial reroute is basically a little scale repiping of several affected locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to only abandon the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost really quickly. This is the main reason we will advise a full repipe in certain neighborhoods, based upon our experience.</p>

<p>In some households, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to method when looking for a feasible option, especially when basic plunging doesn't seem to work. Nevertheless, there are lots of drawbacks to utilizing these dangerous items - not least of which is that they usually contain substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering a blockage, which can range from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small things, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of providing the threat of harm to your home and family.</p>
