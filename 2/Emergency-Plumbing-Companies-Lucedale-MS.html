<h3>Drain Cleaning in Lucedale Mississippi</h2>
<p>There are a number of things that can go wrong with your sewer line. Like all pipes, the sewer line will not last forever. It has actually remained in location since your home was constructed so it has to do with the same age as your home. There are some things that can harm a sewer pipe such as freeze and thaw cycles and rust. Blunt force can break a pipe, such as when building and construction is being done at or near your home.</p>
<p>Home water softeners, also called ion exchange systems, are home appliances that get rid of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium. As soon as the resin beads become filled with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium solution gets rid of the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride option becomes a waste stream that goes down the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
