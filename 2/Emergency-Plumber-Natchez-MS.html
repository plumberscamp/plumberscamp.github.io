<p>Echologics has a long history of developing acclaimed acoustic technologies for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a camera through the household sewer pipes (typically from your house to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be used to evaluate the type and condition of underground pipes, and to recognize problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, clogs, corrosion or collapsed pipes. Property owners may have a video inspection done to find the cause of periodic sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when selling or purchasing an older home.</p>
<p>Filtration in sink taps and fridge water dispensers enhances water's taste, however its steep cost makes it not practical as a household option.
