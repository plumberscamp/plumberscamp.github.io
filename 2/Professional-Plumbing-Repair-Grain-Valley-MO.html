<p>If you don't have a plumber's snake, you can use a wire coat wall mount by correcting it. Of course, it won't reach as far as a plumber's snake would, but it may be long enough to reach some obstructions. Insert it into the kitchen drain or stub pipe to push through or take out the clog if you can reach it. Be careful not to scratch your sink with the wire.</p>
<p>Organic debris, such as hair, food, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the reason for clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's cable television, snake or drain auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's DIY task. If you use the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leaks - so it deserves it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
