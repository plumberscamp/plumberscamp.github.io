Depending on the length of the waste arm, you may be able to cut off its elbow and utilize the rest as a straight discharge tube.</p>

<h3>Plumbing And Water Heater Repair South Hamilton MA</h3>
<p>The most effective way to deal with difficult water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When difficult water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>You hear water leaking or running in the tank. A backflow takes place when water runs backward through your pipes and into the drinking water supply.
