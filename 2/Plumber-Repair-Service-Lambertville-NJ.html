When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When difficult water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the previous if I turned off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was rather reasonable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very happy with their service.</p>
