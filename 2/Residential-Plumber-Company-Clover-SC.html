<h3>Signs That Your Water Heater Needs To Be Repaired Or Replaced in Clover SC 29710</h3>
<p>Backflow means the undesirable turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable water system; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from happening. Points at which a safe and clean water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, however they must be carefully designed and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
