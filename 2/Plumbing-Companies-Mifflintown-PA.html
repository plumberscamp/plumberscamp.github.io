<p>If the problems happens well outside that 8 to 12 year life-span, a rule of thumb is that you can recapture the cost of the repair. If, state, you need a brand-new burner set and the water heater is five years of ages, then it makes good sense for you to spend the $120 for the part, specifically if you can do the work yourself. The closer the home appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limit, the more uncertain the economics of a repair ends up being. The factor is that some other part on the appliance will go or its tank will leak. And there's no cure for a leaking tank.</p>
