<p>Brine Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Features automatic shut-off to avoid overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is almost certainly from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water material of LP or gas is very low. Rainwater which has not infiltrated the earth is an incredibly pure form of water. When water vaporizes it leaves dissolved solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. Therefore when vaporized water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another technique is to introduce a chemical substance that acts as a chelating agent. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating representative and remain suspended in the water instead of building up on surfaces. Nevertheless, if they remain in one place for long, as they might in a water heater, the buildup might still happen.</p>
<p>A cross-connection is any irreversible or short-term connection in between a public water system or customer's safe and clean (i.e., drinking) water supply and any source or system including nonpotable water or other substances.

Based upon the condition of the line, it might be an acceptable alternative to do just that. Nevertheless, if the balanced out worsens trenchless may no longer be an option.</p>
