<p>In some homes, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to approach when searching for a feasible option, specifically when simple plunging does not seem to work. However, there are many downsides to utilizing these dangerous products - not least of which is that they normally consist of substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering a clog, which can range from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, little things, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of presenting the risk of harm to your house and household.</p>
