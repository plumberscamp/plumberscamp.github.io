<p>You most likely understand something about your drains: they take water from your showers, sinks, and bath tubs to a local water treatment facility. When drains are working appropriately that's actually all you need to understand about them, but when something goes wrong, you need to have a much deeper understanding of what kinds of problems can happen in pipes and how to fix them without doing more damage. That's where a professional plumber is available in-- they have the knowledge to diagnose an issue and the tools and knowledge to fix it.</p>
<p>Your waste disposal unit ensures that your sink and plumbing components do not get clogged. Contrary to some people's perception, garbage disposals do not contain blades. Rather, a garbage disposal features 2 stationary bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk. When the disposal is turned on the disks quickly spin, and these bolts require food and particles to grind against a stationary mill along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action efficiently pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without blocking.</p>
