It is very important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the disadvantage turned off remains in the closed position. This permits the parts to move to their pressurized positions in a precise movement. When the assembly is pressurized, then any accumulated air should be eliminated from the body. Most backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from critical locations in the assembly. In some models, test dicks can be used to remove air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a place where the air will build up.</p>

The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. When backwashing is total, the softener can be returned to use. Some water softeners will automatically change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch.
