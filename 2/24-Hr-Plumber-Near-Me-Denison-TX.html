<h3>Emergency Plumber & 24 Hour Plumbing Services Denison TX</h3>
<p>Test for water tightness by plugging the drain with the stopper and filling the sink with an inch of water. Look for leaks under the sink to verify that your plumber's putty is making a great seal. Get rid of the drain stopper, and enable the drain and P-trap to fill with water. Look for leakages and tighten as necessary. Plug unit into a GFCI-protected receptacle, and arrange cables as desired.</p>
<p>3. Consider a hair-stopper: The number 1 factor our Thousand Oaks drain cleaning professionals are called into a house is since there is excessive hair in the shower drain. Hair-stoppers are simple and pretty inexpensive to install, so there's no factor not to. Eventually triggering a backup when grease solidifies it sticks to the pipe and prevents water flow.
