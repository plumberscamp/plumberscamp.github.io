<h3>Cheap And Reliable Plumbers Palos Verdes Peninsula CA</h3>
<p>In water distribution systems, water is generally maintained at a considerable pressure to allow water to stream from the tap, shower, or other fixture. Water pressure may be or fail reduced when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high demand on the water supply (for example, when numerous fire hydrants are opened). Minimized pressure in the pipe may enable polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
<p>The most typical approach for producing soft water is through ion exchange, a process in which the calcium and magnesium in the water are exchanged for another aspect, typically sodium. Salt will not trigger lime scale or soap residue buildup like other minerals do, and water softening includes only an extremely small amount of sodium to your water. According to the Mayo Clinic, an 8-ounce glass of soft water would have less than 12.5 milligrams of salt, which is considered very low sodium" by the Food and Drug Administration.</p>
