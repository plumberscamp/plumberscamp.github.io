<p>Button Plumbing was great. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the previous if I shut off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was quite affordable. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very happy with their service.</p>
