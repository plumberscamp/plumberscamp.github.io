<p>Water softening makes use of a process called "ion exchange" to remove dissolved difficult water minerals such as calcium, manganese, magnesium and iron. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular response is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto sodium, and as the difficult water streams through the resin, the sodium is swapped for the hard water minerals. The hard water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace amount of salt drains with the softened water.</p>

<p>Another typical argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves should prevent backflow.  The obvious problem with this is that if the backflow happens at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard by hand run valve should stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if fully closed, has excellent seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless the majority of the automated valves, such as the electric solenoid valves used for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and fully closed.</p>
