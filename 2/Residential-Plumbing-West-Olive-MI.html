<p>106.2.3 Plumbing Maintenance. The clearing of stoppages in component branches; the fixing of incidental leaks in valves, pipes or fixtures; or the removal and reinstallation of existing or brand-new plumbing fixtures, residential type plumbing appliances, non-testable backflow devices, and plumbing appurtenances; offered that such repairs do not involve or need the replacement of hidden piping, or the rearrangement of valves, pipes or fixtures.</p>
<p>Fire department connections can be an issue when used in combating a fire. Firefighters by and big are not concerned with backflow prevention concerns. They are concerning with protecting individuals's lives and to a lower extent their home. Getting the needed volume of water on a fire is their mission and they will utilize water from any source readily available to accomplish that goal.
