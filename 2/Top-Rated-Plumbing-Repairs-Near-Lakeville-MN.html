<p>Renovation plumbers normally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Once again, this does not include the cost of parts. But more and more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily invest a lot more. With this approach, you know the turnkey cost entering into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's duty, not yours.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters are often called on-demand water heaters. These water heating unit produce warm water as it is needed by heating the water that flows from your water pipe to your tap, bypassing the need for a tank. A tankless hot water heater often costs less to run over its lifetime, but normally costs more in advance than storage tank water heaters. Depending upon your needs, you might need more than one tankless water heater to fulfill your day-to-day hot water needs.</p>
