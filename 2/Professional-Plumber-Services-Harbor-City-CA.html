<p>The pipe-bursting technique is utilized on pipes that are severely damaged, for replacing a whole pipe system, or for repairing larger sections of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to start repair, that includes 2 4 foot square gain access to pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers start by placing a "bursting head" at the gain access to point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is utilized to drag the head through the pipe.
