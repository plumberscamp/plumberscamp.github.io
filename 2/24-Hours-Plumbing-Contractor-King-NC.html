<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Sick Of False Assures? Water distributes in the tank where small resin beads swap the calcium and magnesium in the water for the sodium or potassium they're holding. The beads act as a sponge, adsorbing the solidity minerals from your water. This procedure is described as ion exchange, and soft water is the outcome. When the resin beads have maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be recharged (a process called regrowth). During this process, the resin beads are cleaned with the highly concentrated saltwater solution (brine) from the tank (made from the salt you contributed to the tank).
