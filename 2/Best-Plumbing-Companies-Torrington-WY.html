<p>Water softening makes use of a process called "ion exchange" to remove dissolved hard water minerals such as calcium, manganese, magnesium and iron. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular reaction is required. Water softeners have resin beads that keep salt, and as the difficult water streams through the resin, the salt is switched for the hard water minerals. The hard water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace quantity of salt flows out with the softened water.</p>

<p>There's a good possibility you have galvanized pipes if you have an older home. And if your house was built in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are probably nearing completion of their lifespan. As galvanized pipes age, they start to wear away. This deterioration can cause an accumulation of lead, which can have lots of unfavorable results on your health. Rusty pipes also cause bad water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>With PVC you have a number of options if your pipe is failing; one is to repair the bad connection that is triggering an interruption. The other is to proceed and replace the entire line. Absolutely replace if the line is about 40 years old and is showing indications of age throughout. These days, you can replace the pipe without a digging trench. Based on the condition of the line, it might be an acceptable choice to do simply that. However, if the offset worsens trenchless may no longer be a choice.</p>
