<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was quite sensible. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly happy with their service.</p>
