<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod, gently listen and raise the rod. You may be able to stop the running by adjusting the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float change screw on top (see Figure A below). If there is no change screw, flex the float arm. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, make sure it's changed appropriately (Photo 8). You don't have to empty the tank to make these adjustments.</p>
<p>A backflow preventer is a means or mechanism to avoid backflow. The standard ways of preventing backflow is an air gap, which either eliminates a cross-connection or provides a barrier to backflow. The fundamental system for avoiding backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which provides a physical barrier to backflow. The primary kinds of mechanical backflow preventers are the reduced-pressure concept assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the double check valve assembly.</p>
