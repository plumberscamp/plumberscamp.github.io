As soon as the system is pressurized, air should be removed from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system should be inspected to make sure no valves were unintentionally left open or did not close effectively. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are entirely open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has actually been gone back to service.</p>
