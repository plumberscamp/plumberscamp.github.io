<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Tired of False Guarantees? Water flows in the tank where small resin beads switch the calcium and magnesium in the water for the salt or potassium they're holding. The beads serve as a sponge, adsorbing the solidity minerals from your water. This process is referred to as ion exchange, and soft water is the outcome. When the resin beads have actually maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a process called regeneration).

Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium.
