<p>When to repair: Toilet clogs are not unusual, however if your toilet is clogging more than 3 times a month, there's a bigger problem to analyze. If your toilet is relatively new, you might need to switch toilet paper or work with a plumber to clear a clog from the drain. The National Contractor License Service preserves a list of each state's professional licensing company where you can search for your state's licensing information. Check the list of state licensing firms to find out whether a plumber is licensed in your state. Angie's List also keeps a licensing tool to inspect state licensing requirements.</p>
<p>Your waste disposal unit guarantees that your sink and plumbing fixtures don't get clogged. Contrary to some individuals's perception, garbage disposals do not contain blades. Rather, a garbage disposal features two stationary bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk. When the disposal is switched on the disks quickly spin, and these bolts force food and particles to grind versus a stationary mill along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action successfully pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without clogging.</p>
