Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they should be carefully designed and installed to prevent backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
