Perhaps there is a fracture in the sink's basin and you have actually seen a little leak. In any of these cases, it's best to have plumbing specialists replace your sink so you understand you're getting the greatest quality work.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was great. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the past. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was rather affordable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super happy with their service.</p>
