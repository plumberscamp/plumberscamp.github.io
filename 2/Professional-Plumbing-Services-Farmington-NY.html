<p>Food scraps compose up to 20% of all household waste. If it can quickly and rapidly be disposed of through the sink, this big quantity of garbage does not need to go in the garbage can. A garbage disposal works by shredding the waste into tiny pieces that can traveling through the sewage pipes without hindering water circulation.
