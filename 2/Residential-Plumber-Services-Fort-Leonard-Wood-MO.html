Higher pressure can be caused by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or raised piping in places such as high-rise buildings or tanks. If these connections are not appropriately protected, safe and clean and non-potable water or liquids can be forced into the safe and clean supply system.</p>

This warranty disclaims without constraint implied warranties of merchantability or physical fitness for a specific function or treatment of specific water conditions. Whether you need to prepare food, clean your hands, soak in the shower or a hot bath, or merely mop the floor, both your household water heater and the flow of natural gas contribute essential elements to your household's level of day-to-day comfort and convenience.</p>
