<p>Natural gas is the one we are most carefully exposed to. This gas is used for heating our homes, for lightening our ranges, and for running appliances such as water heaters. This gas is made from a hydrocarbon called methane, unofficially known as marsh gas or swamp gas. Methane is a naturally happening gas that takes place in the earth's crust and is likewise sometimes formed by the decaying of raw materials like sewage or manure. As beneficial as this gas is, the features that make this gas dangerous is its odorless and colorless nature, which makes it a silent killer.
