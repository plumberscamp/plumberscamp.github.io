<p>You probably know something about your drains: they take water from your bathtubs, sinks, and showers to a local water treatment facility. When drains are working effectively that's truly all you need to know about them, but when something goes wrong, you need to have a deeper understanding of what type of problems can occur in pipes and how to fix them without doing more damage. That's where a professional plumber comes in-- they have the know-how to identify an issue and the tools and understanding to fix it.</p>
<p>Clear the trap: If the above methods do not work, the next action would be to remove the P-trap under the sink. Location a container below the area to catch water then unscrew the 2 threaded caps that hold the curved section of the pipe in place. Nowadays, a lot of kitchen drains are made from white PVC pipe with connections that can be unscrewed by hand.</p>
