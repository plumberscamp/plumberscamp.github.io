When the system is pressurized, air needs to be gotten rid of from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system need to be examined to ensure no valves were mistakenly exposed or did not close properly when re-pressurized.

<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the normal option is to have the defective pipes changed. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping comes in.

Steel was the most popular choice for home plumbing for many decades, however steel ultimately struggles with corrosion and does not have the durability of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
