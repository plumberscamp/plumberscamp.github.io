<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on.

He noted that there are specific impurities that residents are handling and an RO can help reduce those problems. Due to being mostly farming in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some property owners are installing ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are an item of agricultural waste. Rinckey kept in mind that these systems remove around 94 percent of nitrates. Arsenic also naturally takes place in some soils and that too can be remedied with the ideal RO system.</p>
