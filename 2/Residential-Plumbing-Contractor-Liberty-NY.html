<p>In some households, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to technique when searching for a feasible option, especially when basic plunging does not appear to work. Nevertheless, there are many drawbacks to using these harmful items - not least of which is that they generally consist of substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing an obstruction, which can vary from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small things, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of providing the risk of damage to your home and household.</p>
