<p>A total repipe of a house's water supply, frequently done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most complex and costly plumbing task, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on entire home repiping. For an outdoor gas light or device whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can cause an obstruction or can cause deterioration that obstructs the line. Just 4" of water pressure can be enough to block a natural gas line. Sound-- Gradually sediment can build up in the bottom of your tank. This sediment ultimately gets hard and eliminates from the capability of your hot water heater. This hardened sediment is likely the source of the noise.</p>
