<h2>Tips To Hire Professional Plumbing Companies in Waltham</h2>

Rely on us for reliable Pearland water heater repair and installation services.</p>
<p>The person who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not needed to obtain this certification. I have actually contacted a few plumbers, and the estimate for backflow testing ranged from $150 - $250, but I would anticipate the price to be significantly less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
