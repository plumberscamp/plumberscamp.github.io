<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Tired of False Guarantees? Water circulates in the tank where tiny resin beads switch the calcium and magnesium in the water for the salt or potassium they're holding. The beads serve as a sponge, adsorbing the hardness minerals from your water. This procedure is referred to as ion exchange, and soft water is the result. When the resin beads have actually maxed out their capability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be recharged (a process called regrowth). During this procedure, the resin beads are cleaned with the highly focused saltwater solution (brine) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank). The salt water forces the calcium and magnesium ions to be launched from the beads and changed with salt or potassium ions.</p>
