Costing less than a complete repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost very rapidly. This is the main reason that we will suggest a complete repipe in particular communities, based upon our experience.</p>
