<p>Organic particles, such as hair, grease, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the reason for clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's cable, snake or drain auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's DIY task. If you use the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it deserves it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
