These products, after all, make the procedure appear pretty easy. Regrettably it's not as simple as you may think, and those items are not necessarily going to fix the issue.

Under the sink, position a container or pan underneath the waste pipe, then use locking-jaw pliers or a pipe wrench to detach the old disposal's tailpiece from the drain line's waste pipe. To loosen the nut, turn it counterclockwise.</p>
<p>So now that you know you have a backup in your main line, how do you clear it? Regrettably, main line clogs are not something a homeowner can fix.
