Like nearly whatever in life, there's a bad and good side to both gas and electrical water heaters.

<p>A waste disposal unit should not leak. It generally indicates wear and tear which is a reasonable sign that its time is up when this takes place. Leakages can be unhygienic and will likewise ultimately trigger stress on other parts of your garbage disposal if you think about what you put down the disposal.
