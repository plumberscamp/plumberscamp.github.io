<p>The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania presently has no licensure or certification requirements for the majority of construction contractors (or their staff members). The key to the technology is being able to control both the crystal development rate and their removal from our polymer beads, thereby getting rid of hardness ions and producing a water softening advantage that does not need replacement chemicals or regeneration of active sites," mentioned Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and primary innovation officer. This innovation is more cost efficient and lasts longer than typical water softening products such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>
<p>You might be tempted to bond or patch a leak shut or replace only a single area of pipe to save cash. While this may operate in the short-term, keep in mind that the weakened pipe is made of the same material as other pipes in your house, suggesting that difficulty might be brewing somewhere else in your plumbing system. Repiping now will offer you assurance and prevent larger leaks down the road.</p>
