Finally, a quality contractor will not risk dealing with an inferior plumber. A basic mistake-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can easily devastate $10,000 worth of walls or hardwood floors and make complex the task with insurance coverage claims, lost time, and lawsuits.

Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they need to be carefully created and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
