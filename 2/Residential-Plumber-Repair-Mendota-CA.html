The installers start by positioning a "bursting head" at the access point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is used to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its way through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and drawing in a new smooth pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic product that will be resistant to root intrusion for up to 100 years.</p>
