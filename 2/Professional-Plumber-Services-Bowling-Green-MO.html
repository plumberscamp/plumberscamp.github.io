<p>Aside from these two important components, there are a myriad of little, possibly less important things that can break or weaken. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust a lot more rapidly. Continuous gross smells coming from the toilet can suggest you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising correctly, you might need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and trigger a leak. Tank covers can break and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed if mishandled. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by pointing out all the important things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part needs to be in good shape for it to work at its best.</p>
