<h3>Three Ways To Find An Emergency Plumber Near Me Lewistown PA</h3>
<p>These people were fantastic! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue on and off for many years now. It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I picked this company since they had fantastic evaluations and a fair rate, and even though the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a big, revolting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a fantastic job tidying up after it as well.</p>
