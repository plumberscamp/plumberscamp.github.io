<p>These guys were remarkable! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem on and off for many years now. It was installed 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I picked this company due to the fact that they had excellent evaluations and a fair rate, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, horrible mess on their hands (literally), and they did an excellent job tidying up after it as well.</p>

Tank water heaters are frequently discovered in the majority of homes. Their components are an insulated tank, typically holding 30-50 gallons of water, to heat and shop the water up until it's required. A pipe emerges from the top to provide warm water to its location, kitchen, bathroom, or other sinks.</p>
