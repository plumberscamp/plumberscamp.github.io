<p>Tom of Gotelli Plumbing supplied excellent service for us in replacing a very balky tub spout, and worn out toilet parts. Not only was he exceptionally professional and thorough but he had the ability to respond to all my concerns worrying the service. If I could, I would offer 6 stars. A camera inspection of your sewer line is among the most efficient ways of finding the exact location of a plumbing issue. A plumber will insert a specifically created waterproof camera through your sewer line and capture live video to figure out where and what the source of the issue is.</p>
<p>A drain professional will need to access the drain line from the roof vents or take out a toilet. This is usually more labor-intensive and might need extra costs. Because the drain machine loses torque the even more you are away from the clog, this is also not as efficient.

PEX and CPVC are both plastics and are exceptional options to the pricey copper piping.</p>
