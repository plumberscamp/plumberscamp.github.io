<p>Foul Sewer Smell: Among the first most obvious signs of a sewer issue is a smell of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the backyard (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be a simple issue such as a broken water seal, or it can show a bigger problem such as a broken sewer pipe. Drain repairs can avoid serious damage to your house. Even if the issue originates with the local system, it's still clever to generate the experts to limit the damage to your home.</p>

You may have a leak someplace if you've been noticing a musty smell establishing in the cabinets under the sink. It could be the drainpipe, the faucet, or perhaps the supply hose.

<p>Deluge systems are designed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems usually are installed in areas where the possibility of a serious fire condition is likely, such as airplane hangars. Water to the system is held back by the deluge valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire happens, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then enables water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>

Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When tough water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
