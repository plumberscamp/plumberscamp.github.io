<p>Backflow preventer installation requires the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed registered designer (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you determine if your building needs a backflow preventer or multiple gadgets, or if you receive an exemption. Exemptions, which are granted in extremely uncommon cases where the structure is deemed to not position a threat to the water supply, need to be submitted with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the homeowner. If your building has an existing backflow preventer, however the DEP has no record of its installation, you must have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, as well as an initial test report of the device for DEP review.</p>
