I will definitely utilize Clog Dawg again. Installing a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical hourly rate of $25 to $70. These costs are in addition to the cost of the disposal unit. If your plumber has a minimum callout charge that is greater than the labor cost for the work, the overall you pay may be higher.</p>
