<p>A. Typically wax doesn't "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undetected issue. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
