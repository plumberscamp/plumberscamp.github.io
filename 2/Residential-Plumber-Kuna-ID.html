<p>An overall repipe of a home's water system, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most expensive and elaborate plumbing job, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on whole house repiping. For an outdoor gas light or device whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can trigger a blockage or can trigger corrosion that blocks the line. Simply 4" of water pressure can be enough to block a natural gas line. Noise-- With time sediment can develop in the bottom of your tank. This sediment eventually gets hard and eliminates from the capacity of your water heater. This hardened sediment is likely the source of the noise.</p>
