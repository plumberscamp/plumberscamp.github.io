This technology is more cost effective and lasts longer than common water softening items such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>

<p>Reverse osmosis uses an applied pressure gradient across a semi permeable membrane to conquer osmotic pressure and remove water particles from the service with hardness ions. The membrane has pores large enough to confess water particles for passage; firmness ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft water supply is devoid of hardness ions without any other ions being included. Membranes are a kind of water filter requiring routine cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
<p>Plumbing is an important part of your home or organisation, and its ability to function is important. If you experience frequent problems with your plumbing, like drains obstructing, this could be a sign of a bigger problem, like a tree root intrusion or a big clog. If the drains clog sometimes but you can usually flush them out, this might be a smaller clog like a buildup of grease from the kitchen, or hair and soap residue from the bathroom. Small blockages can turn into huge ones relatively rapidly.</p>
