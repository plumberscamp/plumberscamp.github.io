The installers begin by placing a "bursting head" at the access point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is utilized to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its way through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and drawing in a new seamless pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic material that will be invulnerable to root intrusion for up to 100 years.</p>
