Electric ranges are likewise easier to install, and unlike gas systems, they are less most likely to lose heat.</p>
<p>Home water softeners, also called ion exchange units, are home appliances that eliminate calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium.

After going through the beads, the resulting chloride solution ends up being a waste stream that decreases the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
