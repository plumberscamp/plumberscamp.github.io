<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and a terrific guy. He told me exactly what to anticipate (cost, time, process) in advance and provided as assured. I will definitely use Clog Dawg once again. Setting up a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with an average per hour rate of $25 to $70. These costs remain in addition to the cost of the disposal unit. The total you pay might be greater if your plumber has a minimum callout cost that is greater than the labor cost for the work.</p>
<p>You live in an older house. If your home is 50 years old or older and you've never ever changed its pipes, there's a good chance that you'll need to have it done soon. Galvanized pipes were most often installed in homes of this age, and these types of pipes are understood to rust and burst when they get old. If so, you may need to include a grounded outlet to power the waste disposal unit if you don't currently have one. This generally adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the general cost of the garbage disposal installation.</p>
<p>Almost all softeners fall under one of two classifications. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will regrow on an established schedule and after that return to service. These work well for households that are on regular water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt since they regenerate whether the resin needs it or not. Demand-control models, with either mechanical and electrical sensors, typically regrow after many gallons of water have actually been softened. If you have a rising and falling water utilize schedule, such models are practical.</p>
