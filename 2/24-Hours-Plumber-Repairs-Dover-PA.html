If you are currently experiencing any flooding on your property when it rains, then there is a great chance that the storm drain is clogged and for that reason needs to be cleaned out. If a clogged storm drain is not dealt with in a timely manner, the chances are high that it will cause additional damage to the storm pipe, which will require repair.</p>
