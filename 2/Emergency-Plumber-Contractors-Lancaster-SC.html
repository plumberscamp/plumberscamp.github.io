<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the hard water is softened. The supply of water line feeds the difficult water into the tank. The water leaks through the bed of resin beads, depositing the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and flows through your pipes and out to your household appliances. Backflow is a term utilized in the plumbing world to describe an unwanted circulation of water in the reverse instructions. The backflow of water carries pollutants back to the main water supply system, making the water in it risky to drink.</p>
