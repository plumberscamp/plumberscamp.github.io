<p>Sometimes, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as basic as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces data on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test data indicates for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester interprets the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
