It was set up 7 years back, and it never ever drained this well. I selected this company due to the fact that they had excellent evaluations and a reasonable price, and despite the fact that the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a big, horrible mess on their hands (literally), and they did a terrific job tidying up after it as well.</p>
