<h3>Hour Emergency Plumbing Service Croydon PA</h3>
<p>These men were amazing! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem off and on for years now. It was set up 7 years back, and it never ever drained this well. I selected this company due to the fact that they had excellent evaluations and a reasonable price, and despite the fact that the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a big, horrible mess on their hands (literally), and they did a terrific job tidying up after it as well.</p>
