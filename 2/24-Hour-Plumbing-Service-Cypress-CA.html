Recent Review: Carlos and Lopez were remarkable. My 90 year old Dad's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos got to 8am the next day to repair. Because of the age of the house and location of the pipe, it was a challenging job. They worked for nearly 12 hours into darkness to ensure the system was working before they left. I am really grateful for their hard work and professionalism.</p>
<p>Damage control is a problem. As a sewer and drain cleaning company, I encounter circumstances, on a regular basis that require a company such as Serve Pro to precede me on the job. In some cases, the basements are so loaded with sewage, I can not safely run and go into the basement up until the sewage is extracted and the basement is typically cleaned up. I 'd like to publish some pictures of this. Simply look on line. The problem does exist.</p>

<p>A reduced pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is set up in high risk" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has two spring checks, however also has a third check valve that is really a vent available to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk situations is since if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve uses an additional layer of protection compared to the DC, which will permit backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the reason that when you test an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>
