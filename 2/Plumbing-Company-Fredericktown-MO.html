<p>Your kitchen sink is an integral part of your house, which makes its plumbing's efficient functioning a necessity more than a need. As soon as the test results show the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated throughout the repair process. It is important that the plumbing system be switched on very gradually to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air should be removed from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system should be inspected to guarantee no valves were inadvertently left open or did not close effectively when re-pressurized. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are totally open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has been gone back to service.</p>
