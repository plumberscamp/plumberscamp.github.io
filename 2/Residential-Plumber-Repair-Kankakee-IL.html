First, plans for each device to be installed must be drawn up by a RA or PE, and an application for approval sent out to the DEP, which might take up to three weeks or more to process and approve. Turned down plans should be revised and resubmitted to the DEP approval queue, which can include another numerous weeks to the timeline.</p>
