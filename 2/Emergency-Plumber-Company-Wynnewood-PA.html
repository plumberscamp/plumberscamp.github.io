<p>Figuring out if you need a water softener is a personal choice. Water softener systems work by getting rid of hardness minerals and changing them with sodium ions. Water conditioners are gadgets that help avoid the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They utilize a physical media to prevent the scale from building up by reducing the effects of the solidity itself. Due to the reality that water conditioners utilize a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are often thought about a greener alternative in areas where it is prohibited to utilize salt. Water conditioners do not successfully remove hardness from the water supply, nevertheless, as the only way to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
