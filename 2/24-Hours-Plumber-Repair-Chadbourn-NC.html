<p>This is the product that you most likely initially visualize when you think of a warm water heater. An upright cylindrical tank that heats a set amount of water, with either gas or electrical power, and is available when your faucets and shower need it. It's an extremely quick, powerful method that has been the norm for many years. The integrated water and space heaters are a effective and efficient  alternative that can be used to heat up your home as well as heat water for domestic purposes.</p>
<p>Was your house constructed prior to the 1970s and has not gone through improvement or pipe replacement? If so, it is likely that your pipes are made from galvanized metal or another material which has actually corroded and rotted over the years. Older pipes can trigger significant leakages and even contaminate your water as they decay. Even the greatest quality pipes won't last permanently and will need to be replaced.</p>
