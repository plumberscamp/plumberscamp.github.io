<h3>How Often Should Plumbing Check Webster FL</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation needs the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed registered architect (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you identify if your building needs a backflow preventer or multiple devices, or if you get approved for an exemption. Exemptions, which are approved in incredibly unusual cases where the structure is deemed to not position a threat to the supply of water, need to be submitted with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your building has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you need to have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, along with a preliminary test report of the device for DEP evaluation.</p>
