<p>Check the washer for wear or fractures when you remove the cap to flush out the valve. Replacing a bad washer is low-cost and simple. However finding the ideal washer may not be. The most typical washers are often readily available in your home centers and hardware shops. Other styles can be hard to find. If you decide to hunt for a washer, remove it and take it to the store to discover a match. Plumbers normally replace the entire fill valve instead of hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
