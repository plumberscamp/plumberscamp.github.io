The exposure to carbon monoxide gas is so fatal that anybody who inhales it needs immediate medical attention. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention revealed that 5149 individuals passed away from carbon monoxide gas poisoning between 1999 and 2010.

The same opts for portable gas stoves, which are to be utilized outdoors only and not inside. When running the space-heaters, ensure someone is awake to monitor them. Many households die in their sleep due to carbon monoxide gas poisoning overnight. Another safety measure to take is to never run your generators in enclosed spaces.
