Examining the water meter is an excellent next step in your plumbing inspection. Close all faucets and examine if the water meter is turning. There is a leak somewhere and this could be serious issue if it is. Carry on to the valves. Start with the main shut off valve operation. When shut off, no faucet in your home must have water. This goes for every other shut off valve and their corresponding faucets. You are off to a great start if whatever is working correctly.</p>

Property owners who get a supply of tough water should get a water conditioner device like a water softener installed at their place.
