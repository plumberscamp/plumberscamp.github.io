<p>Prior to the repair service technician starts the repair procedure, he should make certain he has actually examined the workspace around the backflow prevention assembly in order to recognize any limiting conditions. If the area is thought about a confined area, correct security preventative measures need to be followed for correct entry. A safe and proper workplace may entail the positioning of safety barriers or entry limitations around the workspace so the repair service technician or the general public around your workspace are not damaged. If the backflow preventer is set up in a restrictive area, this might affect the technician's ability to effectively finish the repair.</p>
