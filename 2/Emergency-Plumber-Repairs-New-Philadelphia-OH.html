<p>Your kitchen sink is an essential part of your home, which makes its plumbing's efficient functioning a necessity more than a need. Once the test results show the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated throughout the repair process. It is necessary that the plumbing system be switched on very gradually to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air needs to be gotten rid of from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system should be inspected to guarantee no valves were unintentionally left open or did not close effectively. When the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are completely open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has been gone back to service.</p>
