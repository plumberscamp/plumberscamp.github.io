When something obstructs the pipes, anything you pour down there will not go through.</p>

Others might not meet state and local regulations and might need to be replaced with the appropriate backflow preventer.</p>
<p>If you observe low water pressure or discolored water, it generally represents rust and mineral accumulation.
