<p>Defective plumbing and fixtures can be more than an annoyance: It can cost you cash in increased water expenses and cause structural damage to your house. 10 percent of homes nationwide have leakages in their plumbing that waste more than 90 gallons of water a day, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

<p>A. Normally wax does not "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" unnoticed problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
<p>If you see low water pressure or tarnished water, it generally signifies rust and mineral buildup. As rust and minerals build up with time, they constrict the circulation of the water which is why you might notice lower water pressure. The staining takes place when rust becomes loose from the pipes and flow into your supply of water, impacting the water quality. Having plumbing pipes that have rust or corrosion can become a health risk in your water.</p>
<p>When a plumbing license has actually been issued in mistake since of incorrect, inaccurate or incomplete details, or the work for which the permit was issued breaks the Uniform Code, such authorization shall be withdrawed or suspended till such time as the authorization holder demonstrates that all work finished and all work proposed will remain in compliance with applicable provisions of the code.</p>
