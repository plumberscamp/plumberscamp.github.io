<p>The trick to avoiding a clogged garbage disposal is moderation. As long as the food waste is sent through the disposal at a reasonable amount, there need to be no problem in getting the majority of the waste through. There are a few food products you ought to probably not put into the waste disposal unit though. Those items are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another idea to stop clogging is to watch out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will harden when they cool so it is best to clean pots and pans that have those liquids under hot water and to continue to let the water run for numerous seconds after you are completed cleaning to make sure the drain is clear.</p>
