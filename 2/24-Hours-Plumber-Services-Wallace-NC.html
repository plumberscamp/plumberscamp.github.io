<p>A leaking toilet can waste water and trigger water damage, and a running toilet wastes as much as 7,500 gallons of water each year, triggering water expenses to increase. Regardless of the source of the issue, we are equipped to accurately identify the problem and repair your toilet right the first time.

<p>The best source for this type of plumber is a general contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work prior to it's covered; you do not get that opportunity. In addition, your contractor knows the dead giveaways of quality work that you might miss out on, like clean solder joints, crisp 90-degree angles at joints and clean, properly sized holes in joists, studs, and floorings. Lastly, a quality contractor will not risk dealing with a shoddy plumber. A simple error-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can easily ravage $10,000 worth of walls or hardwood floors and make complex the task with insurance coverage claims, lost time, and suits. With so much riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick to only the very best.</p>
<p>At this moment, the professional crew ensures everything is running correctly. Your plumbing system is tested for integrity, and all connections are checked. A professional site inspection is crucial to an effective repipe. When the plumbing system is examined and okayed, its time to clean up the mess. Its time to spot the holes in the wall and repaint. After the brand-new piping system is set up, the water is turned back on, and the plumbing system is pressure tested and after that flushed out.</p>
