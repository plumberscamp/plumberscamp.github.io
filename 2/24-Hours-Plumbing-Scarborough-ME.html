<h3>Residential Plumbing Emergencies Scarborough ME</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable supply of water pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
