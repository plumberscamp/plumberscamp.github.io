Not just will they use water from any readily available source to achieve their goal, however fire department cars often bring non-potable water treated with antifreeze, deterioration inhibitors, or extinguishing representatives.</p>
<p>Often brought on by slow seepage from the tank into the bowl. Put a few drops of food coloring in the tank. Wait an hour, then examine and see if you see coloring in the bowl. This suggests a leaky flapper valve. Replacement is generally the fix. Alternatively, often a malfunctioning fill valve might actuate periodically, too. Water won't drain or is draining slowly through the disposal.</p>
