<p>The next requirements to examine is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is important that the repair technician understands the right installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to guarantee there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly should be installed in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. Most backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, however it is important that the assembly just be installed if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work effectively and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work due to the fact that the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
