<p>Frequently triggered by slow seepage from the tank into the bowl. Put a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank. Wait an hour, then see and examine if you see coloring in the bowl. This shows a leaky flapper valve. Replacement is typically the fix. Alternatively, in some cases a malfunctioning fill valve may actuate intermittently, also. Water won't drain or is draining pipes gradually through the disposal.</p>
<p>Do not use ground joint unions other than straight at the meter or after the shutoff valve at the device. Each location where you will have a gas device must have a gas shutoff valve.
