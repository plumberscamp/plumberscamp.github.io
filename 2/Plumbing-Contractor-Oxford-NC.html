<p>Once the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and inspected and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some parts may have really tight tolerances that need to be kept. An important thing to recognize on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the motion or directs of the element. The guide is a really important part of the design of each part. If the element is not repaired appropriately, the guide might restrict the movement (instead of steady or direct) of the component, which might cause the component to not work to its abilities.
