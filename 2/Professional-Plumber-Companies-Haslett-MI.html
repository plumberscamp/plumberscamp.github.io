<h3>Plumber Installation & Repair Service Haslett MI</h3>
<p>These men were incredible! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue on and off for years now. It was set up 7 years ago, and it never drained this well. I chose this company because they had fantastic reviews and a fair price, and even though the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a great job tidying up after it also.</p>
<p>Anything that decreases returns up again - This is the 2nd most common sign that your drains are clogged. When you discover that the water you send down returns up after a while, it suggests your drains are entirely blocked, and the water is searching for another escape. This is a sure sign that you need drain repair or rooter service in Los Angeles.</p>
