<p>The U-shaped pipe underneath kitchen and bathroom sinks is something that people anticipate to see but rarely stop to consider. The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you flip the switch, but it does not grind up food, this indicates the flywheel is stuck. Attempt freeing the jam by placing a hex wrench of the proper size into the hole on the bottom of the waste disposal unit. At the same time, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom handle (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
<p>The sewer camera inspection enables you to in fact see the interior condition of the drain line. It also lets you see the material the drain line is made from. You can tell if the problem with your drain line is in a particular location, or if the entire line or a part of the sewer line needs changing. If there is a break in the line, the camera not only validates the location of the break but allows you to see the nature of the break, as well. When preparing to link another sewer into the line, a camera can also be used to aesthetically examine the condition of a sewer line. It can also be used for pre-house sales or whenever the need develops to validate that a sewer is in great condition.</p>
