<p>Button Plumbing was great. They changed my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the previous if I shut off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was quite sensible. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was super happy with their service.</p>
