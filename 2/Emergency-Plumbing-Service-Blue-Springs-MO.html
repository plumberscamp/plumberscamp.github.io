<p>Reverse osmosis uses an applied pressure gradient across a semi permeable membrane to conquer osmotic pressure and remove water molecules from the solution with firmness ions. The membrane has pores big enough to admit water molecules for passage; solidity ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft water system is without solidity ions without any other ions being added. Membranes are a kind of water filter requiring routine cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>

Tank lids can break and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed if mishandled.
