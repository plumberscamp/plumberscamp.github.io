<p>When the components are positioned back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is ready to be pressurized. It is very important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the downside shut off remains in the closed position. This allows the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in an exact motion. When the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air should be removed from the body. Most backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from important areas in the assembly. In some designs, test cocks can be used to get rid of air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a location where the air will accumulate.</p>

<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the inbound potable water supply.

To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common type of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
