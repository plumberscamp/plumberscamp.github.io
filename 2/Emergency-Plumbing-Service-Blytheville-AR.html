<p>Changing your sink is a detailed process. Measure, cut, and connect the pipes. Prior to connecting any pipes to your water softener, measure and cut your pipes to fit. If you are utilizing copper pipes, solder on any nipples and fittings before connecting the system to the bypass valve to prevent melting the plastic. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can also be utilized. Though it may need additional adapters, flexible tubing is far easier to deal with and can use push-to-connect fittings, saving you time and the hassle of soldering.</p>
<p>Include more warm water if it gradually drains away as you work. Keep plunging up until the drain is clear or you decide it's time to try a brand-new approach. Tankless units connect directly to your plumbing and only heat the water as it is needed. This results in savings on your energy bill. Check Valve Assembly (DC): A DC is a mechanical backflow preventer that includes two separately acting, spring-loaded check valves.</p>
