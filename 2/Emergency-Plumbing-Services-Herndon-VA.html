<p>In some cases, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates information on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to understand what the field test information implies for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester translates the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
