<p>Changing your sink is a detailed procedure. Step, cut, and link the pipes. Prior to connecting any pipes to your water softener, measure and cut your pipes to fit. If you are using copper pipes, solder on any nipples and fittings before linking the unit to the bypass valve to avoid melting the plastic. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can also be utilized. Though it may require additional adapters, versatile tubing is far simpler to deal with and can make use of push-to-connect fittings, conserving you time and the hassle of soldering.</p>

This can force the drinkable water to reverse its direction of circulation through the cross-connection between the two systems. Possible pollutants can then get in the safe and clean water system.

In some locations of Virginia, where the water is particularly hard with high mineral material, you may need to flush the hot water heater more often.</p>
