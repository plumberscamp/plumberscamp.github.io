<p>Likewise called a garbage disposer, a waste disposal unit comes in two basic types - constant feed, which generally has a wall-mounted switch so the unit keeps running as you drop more waste in; and batch feed, which requires a food cover be in place to run the system.

You may need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising appropriately. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. If mishandled, tank covers can split and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by discussing all the things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part needs to be in great shape for it to work at its best.</p>
