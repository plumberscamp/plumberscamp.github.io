Points at which a safe and clean water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, however they must be thoroughly created and installed to prevent backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
