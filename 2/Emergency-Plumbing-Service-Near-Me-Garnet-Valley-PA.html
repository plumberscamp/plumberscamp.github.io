<p>You live in an older house. There's a great opportunity that you'll need to have it done quickly if your house is 50 years old or older and you have actually never ever changed its pipes. Galvanized pipes were most often set up in houses of this age, and these types of pipes are known to rust and burst when they get old.

<p>Sometimes, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates data on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test data suggests for that particular assembly.  When a qualified tester interprets the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
