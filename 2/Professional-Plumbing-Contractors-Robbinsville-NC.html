<h3>Sewer Pipe Repair in Robbinsville North Carolina</h2>
<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of several afflicted locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to only abandon the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost really quickly. This is the main reason we will advise a full repipe in particular areas, based on our experience.</p>
