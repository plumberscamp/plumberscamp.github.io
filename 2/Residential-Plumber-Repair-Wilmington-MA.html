<p>If the problems happens well outside that 8 to 12 year life expectancy, a guideline of thumb is that you can recapture the cost of the repair. If, say, you need a new burner package and the water heater is five years of ages, then it makes good sense for you to invest the $120 for the part, especially if you can do the work yourself. The closer the home appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limitation, the more uncertain the economics of a repair becomes. The factor is that some other part on the home appliance will go or its tank will leak. And there's no treatment for a leaking tank.</p>

Anything you pour down there won't go through when something obstructs the pipes.</p>
