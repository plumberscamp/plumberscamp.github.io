<p>A partial reroute is basically a little scale repiping of one or more affected locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to only abandon the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost very quickly. This is the main reason that we will suggest a complete repipe in particular communities, based upon our experience.</p>

With your water heater, she or he is taking a look at water temperature level, pressure relief valves and pipes, and any rust in the tank (unless it's a tankless water heater ).
