<p>Backpressure is produced when pressure in a water system exceeds the pressure in the safe and clean system offering the make-up water. This can force the safe and clean water to reverse its direction of flow through the cross-connection between the 2 systems. Possible pollutants can then get in the drinkable water supply. The best way to lower build-up is have a professional flush it at least as soon as a year.
