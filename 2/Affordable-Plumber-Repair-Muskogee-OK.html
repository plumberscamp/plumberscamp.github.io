Some house owners will attempt to dislodge the clog utilizing store-bought drain cleaners and natural home remedies, like vinegar or lemon juice with baking soda. These treatments do work, particularly if you are dealing with a small drain clog. Nevertheless, they are normally temporary repairs that do not offer long-term resolutions.</p>
