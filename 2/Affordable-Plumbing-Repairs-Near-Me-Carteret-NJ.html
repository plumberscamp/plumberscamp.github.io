<p>In some households, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to method when looking for a viable solution, particularly when basic plunging doesn't appear to work. However, there are numerous drawbacks to using these dangerous items - not least of which is that they generally contain compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing an obstruction, which can range from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small items, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, however at the cost of presenting the threat of damage to your house and family.</p>
