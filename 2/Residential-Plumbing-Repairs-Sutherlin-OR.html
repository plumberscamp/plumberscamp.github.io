<p>An overall repipe of a house's water supply, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most intricate and costly plumbing job, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on whole home repiping. For an outdoor gas light or device whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can trigger a blockage or can cause rust that obstructs the line.

Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable water system pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
