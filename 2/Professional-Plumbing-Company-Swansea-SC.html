It has two spring checks, however also has a third check valve that is actually a vent open to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk circumstances is since if the very first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens.
