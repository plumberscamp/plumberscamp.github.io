<h3>Experts In Plumbing, Heating, Cooling & Electrical Services Fort Lauderdale FL</h3>
<p>These men were incredible! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue on and off for years now. It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company because they had great evaluations and a reasonable rate, and although the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, horrible mess on their hands (literally), and they did a fantastic job cleaning up after it also.</p>
