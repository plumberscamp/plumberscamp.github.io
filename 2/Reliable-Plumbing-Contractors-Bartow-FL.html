<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the homes in our area were built prior to 1965, which is the time when copper piping for hot and cold water became basic. Older homes were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that comes in contact with water and oxygen will corrode. This corrosion, or rust, triggers the iron to inflate and end up being flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and creates a waterproof membrane to safeguard the iron from rusting.</p>

<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the past. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was rather affordable. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly pleased with their service.</p>
