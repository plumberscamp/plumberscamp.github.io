It is very important that the repair technician understands the appropriate installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly.

Many backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, but it is important that the assembly only be installed if it is authorized for that orientation.
