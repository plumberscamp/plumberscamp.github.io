<p>A rule of thumb is that you can recapture the cost of the repair if the problems takes place well outside that 8 to 12 year life-span. If, say, you need a new burner package and the water heater is 5 years of ages, then it makes good sense for you to spend the $120 for the part, especially if you can do the work yourself. The closer the home appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limit, the more uncertain the economics of a repair becomes. The reason is that some other part on the device will go or its tank will leak. And there's no remedy for a leaking tank.</p>
