<p>Water softeners will go to drain throughout backwash and quick rinse anywhere from 2 to 4 GPM (depending on the size of the unit).

<h3>Local Plumbers & Contractors Durham NC</h3>
<p>Another typical argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves need to avoid backflow.  The apparent issue with this is that if the backflow occurs at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic manually run valve needs to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if totally closed, has good seals, and does not leak.  However the majority of the automatic valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves utilized for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and completely closed.</p>
<p>This is a sign you may need a toilet repair or replacement if you are discovering yourself flushing the toilet more than typical (or even more than once). This could be an indication that the mechanism that flushes needs replaced, the water jets are simply not working to flush the excrement down, or your water pressure is too low. No matter the cause, Vegas Valley Plumbing must be hired to have a gander at your toilet.</p>
