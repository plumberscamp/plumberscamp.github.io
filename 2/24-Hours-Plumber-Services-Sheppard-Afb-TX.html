<p>Brine Valve - Controls water flow in and out of salt tank. Features automated shut-off to avoid overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is likely from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water material of LP or gas is extremely low. Rainwater which has not infiltrated the earth is a remarkably pure kind of water. When water vaporizes it leaves behind dissolved solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. Therefore when vaporized water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a worn flapper is normally the culprit. But not always. First, look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing strongly if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with insufficient slack can cause trouble too. Picture 3 shows how to set the slack just right.</p>
