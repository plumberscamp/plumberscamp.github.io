Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable supply of water pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on.
