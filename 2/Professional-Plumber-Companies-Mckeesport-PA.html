<p>For plumbing work other that repair or replacement fixtures, a structure authorization is typically required before a plumbing authorization can be released. Soften only what you need to.

<p>Frequently caused by slow seepage from the tank into the bowl. Put a few drops of food coloring in the tank. Wait an hour, then see and examine if you see coloring in the bowl. This indicates a leaky flapper valve. Replacement is normally the fix. Alternatively, in some cases a malfunctioning fill valve may actuate periodically, as well. Water won't drain or is draining gradually through the disposal.</p>
<p>In the meantime, however, we suggest you first try utilizing non-harsh and non-abrasive white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Just pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, include some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. You can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that doesn't work. A lot of these cleaners include concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be very hazardous if it comes in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. Please make sure to take the appropriate precautions if using among these products.</p>
