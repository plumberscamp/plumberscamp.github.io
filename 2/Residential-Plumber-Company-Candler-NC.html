A hot water heater is basically a household device that consists of a gas or electric heating unit under a tank in which water is heated and stored. You do not need a plumbing license for simple repairs such as unclogging a sink or if a plumbing authorization is provided as part of a larger residential structure license or commercial structure license.</p>
<p>Renovation plumbers generally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Again, this doesn't include the cost of parts. However more and more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly invest much more. With this approach, you know the turnkey rate going into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's duty, not yours.</p>
