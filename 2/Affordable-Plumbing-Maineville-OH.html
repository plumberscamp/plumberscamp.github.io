<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of several afflicted locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to only desert the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost really quickly. This is the main reason that we will recommend a complete repipe in specific areas, based upon our experience.</p>
