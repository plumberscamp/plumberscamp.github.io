<h2>Tips To Hire Emergency Plumbing Contractors in Springfield</h2>
<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the homes in our area were developed prior to 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water ended up being standard. Older homes were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that can be found in contact with water and oxygen will wear away. This corrosion, or rust, triggers the iron to swell up and become flaky. In order to prevent the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and creates a waterproof membrane to secure the iron from rusting.</p>
<p>The person who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not required to obtain this certification. I've talked to a few plumbers, and the estimate for backflow testing varied from $150 - $250, but I would expect the rate to be significantly less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>

<h3>How To Stop Emergency Plumbing Water Damages Springfield VA</h3>
