<p>Family operated and owned since 2003, RT Plumbing Services delivers industry-leading plumbing know-how, house redesigning service, and water heater conversions and replacements to the greater Fort Worth, TX community. It's important to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much higher pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Fluctuations in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will trigger an appropriately functioning RPZ assembly to occasionally discharge percentages of water. During a backflow condition, a large volume of water will flow from the relief valve. For this factor, RPZ assemblies shouldn't be installed in areas based on water damage. Sufficient drainage needs to also be provided.</p>
