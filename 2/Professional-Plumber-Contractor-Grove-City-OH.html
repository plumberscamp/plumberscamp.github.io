As hard water goes through the mineral tank, the beads inside attract the positively-charged calcium and magnesium ions. The minerals that cause difficult water stay with the beads, and the treated water goes out into your home's plumbing system.</p>
<p>Clark's Process: This procedure is likewise called lime softening. The chemical calcium hydroxide, called limewater, is added to water, which causes the firmness ions to precipitate. The alkalinity of the water is raised through this addition to above 9.6, so carbon dioxide should be contributed to re-carbonate the water and bring the pH pull back.
