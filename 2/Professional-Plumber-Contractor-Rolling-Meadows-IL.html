<p>Examine the washer for wear or fractures when you eliminate the cap to flush out the valve. Changing a bad washer is inexpensive and simple. But discovering the right washer might not be. The most common washers are often offered in the house centers and hardware shops. Other styles can be difficult to discover. If you choose to hunt for a washer, remove it and take it to the shop to discover a match. Plumbers generally replace the whole fill valve rather than hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
