<p>The electrical and plumbing work associated with garbage disposal installation make the task possibly harmful. That makes it a great reason to employ a professional plumber to install or replace your disposal. Homeowners can either purchase the brand-new disposal themselves and supply it to the professional for installation, or let the plumber purchase the disposal on their behalf and include it in the total cost.</p>

New meters need to meet guidelines and code requirements for their placement, and gas companies may require a special meter for their services, restricting your choices.
