<p>If you've always resided in an area with difficult water, you may not understand just how much it impacts you-- however if you've just recently moved from an area with soft water, you're likely all too aware of the dry, irritated skin and frizzy, dull hair that can arise from difficult water. Difficult water interferes with the lathering of hair shampoos and soaps, triggering you to use more. Hard water also makes it harder to wash soap off your body, or hair shampoo out of your hair, which can result in dandruff and itching of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely find that tough water triggers your skin to flake, itch, and redden often.</p>
