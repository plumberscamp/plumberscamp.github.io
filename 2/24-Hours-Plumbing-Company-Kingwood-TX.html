<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water supply pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in drinkable water system pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
