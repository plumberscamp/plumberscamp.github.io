<p>The cost to replace galvanized pipes is from $2,000 to $15,000 depending on if you use PEX, copper, or another material. Due to the fact that of the way galvanized pipes tend to break down over the years, replacing galvanized pipes in older homes is essential. Galvanized pipe is made by covering steel pipe with zinc. As time proceed, the zinc deteriorates, exposing the steel.</p>
