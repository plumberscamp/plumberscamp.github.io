<p>E.R. Services comprehends the importance of maintaining the integrity and performance of your kitchen. Sediment Build-Up: If you notice strange popping, banging, or clanging noises coming from your unit, this might be a sign that sediment has developed in your tank, and is triggering a response with the heating component.

It is important that the repair technician knows the appropriate installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to guarantee there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly should be set up in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. Most backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, but it is very important that the assembly just be installed if it is authorized for that orientation.
