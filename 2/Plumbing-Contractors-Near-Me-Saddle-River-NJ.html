Most of toilets are basic sized - implying a "will fit" seat is sufficient for safety and comfort. Some toilets, nevertheless, have actually distinctively shaped bowls and need a particular seat, like the Eljer Symbol. It really isn't a great concept to use a toilet seat that is either much too big or much to small, unless they have actually been particularly designed to fit normal toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and cause you to slide around, or won't distribute your weight evenly and might eventually trigger cracks in the bowl.</p>
