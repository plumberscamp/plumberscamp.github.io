<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and a fantastic man. He informed me exactly what to expect (cost, time, procedure) in advance and provided as promised. I will definitely utilize Clog Dawg again. Installing a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with an average hourly rate of $25 to $70. These costs are in addition to the cost of the disposal unit. The overall you pay might be greater if your plumber has a minimum callout charge that is greater than the labor cost for the work.</p>
<p>One common way for a home's water supply to be contaminated is if the watering water lines, which could end up being polluted by pesticides or weed poison, backflow into the interior water lines. If that polluted water were to backflow into the neighborhood drinking supply, the issue might spread out exponentially. A backflow preventer not just safeguards drinking water in private houses, it also prevents wastewater in private houses from receding out and infecting the public water system.</p>
<p>If the hot water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank, that is an indication the tank is failing and will need to be replaced. If it is in a garage and a small slow leak, schedule a price quote as quickly as possible and make sure absolutely nothing is near the heater that might be potentially harmed. Leaking hot water heater can burst causing water damage and flooding of homes.</p>
