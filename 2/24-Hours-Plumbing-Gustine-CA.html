<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the inbound potable water system. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when negative or decreased pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common kind of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>

Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions.
