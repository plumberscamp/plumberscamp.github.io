<p>Button Plumbing was great. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather affordable. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly delighted with their service.</p>
