<p>E.R. Services understands the significance of maintaining the integrity and efficiency of your kitchen. Minerals such as calcium and magnesium, both have a positive charge. Sodium, the mineral that water softeners use to replace firmness ions, likewise has a positive charge, so none of these ions are attracted to each other. However, sodium's charge is weaker than that of calcium and magnesium. If ions aren't attracted to each other, how can an exchange take place? There is one other crucial aspect needed to make the process work: a resin bed including lots of tiny, negatively-charged beads.</p>
<p>As part of EBMUD's program, the District's backflow inspectors are required to perform site inspections to identify if a backflow prevention device is needed as a result of a actual or possible  cross-connection hazard on a customer's plumbing system.

Spot Repairs: Using one or a mix of the above services, we will fix the problems we find with the camera inspection directly without rooting out anymore than we need to.</p>

<p>Having your plumbing frequently examined is a crucial part of preventative maintenance. However, lots of house owners and business owners have an out of sight, out of mind" method to plumbing and do not assess their pipes till there is a pushing concern.

<p>Light Blue = Lowered Pressure Zone - supply pressure presses open the # 1 check and is minimized by the # 1 Examine spring (for instance, to 90 psi). This pressure distinction throughout the # 1 check valve maintains the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone increases towards the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, avoiding backflow (reverse motion of fluid).</p>

<p>Reverse osmosis utilizes an applied pressure gradient across a semi permeable membrane to conquer osmotic pressure and get rid of water molecules from the solution with firmness ions.

Water softeners generally use salt (Na+) as the exchange ion. Sodium ions are supplied from liquified salt chloride salt, also called salt water. In the ion exchange process, sodium ions are utilized to coat an exchange medium in the softener The exchange medium can be natural zeolites" or artificial resin beads that resemble wet sand.</p>
<p>Template-Assisted Crystallization: Shortened to TAC, this technique uses resin beads as a catalytic nucleation website where solidity mineral ions are become a steady crystalline type that will not hold on to surface areas.
