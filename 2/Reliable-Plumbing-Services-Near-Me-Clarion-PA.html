Put simply, it's a device that ensures water flows in one direction. When you have a sewer issue, you'll want the sewer repair procedure to reduce interruptions to your home or service. You probably don't wish to dig up your outdoor patio, parking lot or landscape.</p>
<p>If you hear water running in your toilet and you believe a leaky toilet tank or toilet bowl, try this: squirt a couple of drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and let the toilet sit for about half an hour.
