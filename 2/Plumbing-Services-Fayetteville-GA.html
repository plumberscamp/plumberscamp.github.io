<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable supply of water pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in drinkable water system pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized surpasses the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
