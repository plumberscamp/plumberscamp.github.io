<p>Viking SupplyNet's substantial stock of backflow valves and associated devices includes leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water system react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and become fragile. This leads to micro-fractures and reduces the standard structural integrity of the system. The system ends up being weak and might stop working without caution, causing damage to the building structure and personal effects. Incorrect installation is also a typical reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly impossible to detect.</p>

Our equipment is trenchless-based, and the liner we place into the sewer line has the ability to inflate in order to apply the epoxy resin.

Expected to last fifty years or more, these sewer lines are designed to be effective and durable, resisting deterioration and other common problems that can plague other pipeline material types.</p>

<p>Deluge systems are designed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems usually are installed in locations where the possibility of a severe fire condition is likely, such as aircraft hangars. Water to the system is kept back by the deluge valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then enables water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
