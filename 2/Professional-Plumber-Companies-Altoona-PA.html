<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water system pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable water supply pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
