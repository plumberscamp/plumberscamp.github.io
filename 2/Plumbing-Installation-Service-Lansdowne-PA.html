<p>As soon as the parts are put back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is prepared to be pressurized. It is very important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the disadvantage shut off remains in the closed position. This enables the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in an accurate motion. As soon as the assembly is pressurized, then any accumulated air should be removed from the body. Many backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from vital locations in the assembly.
