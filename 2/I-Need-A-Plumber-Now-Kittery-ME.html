Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in safe and clean supply of water pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>

Individuals frequently choose to soften showers, sinks, and laundry connections. Toilets, hose bibs, basement sinks, and other cold water taps usually do not need to be linked to a softener. Oftentimes, individuals select to soften just the warm water.</p>
