As a security preventative measure, we add a chemical odorant called mercaptan that gives gas a smell often connected with rotten eggs. This distinct scent permits you to smell a prospective leak if it occurs. Always leave if you presume a leak.</p>
<p>Toilets are hard things to know. They've been built practically the exact same way for hundreds of years, so you can't actually tell how old they are. It might not work very well all the time, but you can't inform if that's normal or not.

<p>When you eliminate the cap to flush out the valve, examine the washer for wear or cracks. Changing a bad washer is cheap and easy. But finding the right washer may not be.

Eliminate it and take it to the shop to find a match if you choose to hunt for a washer. Plumbers usually replace the whole fill valve instead of hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
