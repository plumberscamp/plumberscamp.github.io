<p>Chelation: Another technique is to introduce a chemical compound that serves as a chelating agent. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating agent and stay suspended in the water rather than developing on surface areas. Nevertheless, if they remain in one place for long, as they might in a hot water heater, the buildup could still happen.</p>
<p>Set up 50 gallon electrical hot water heater and thermal growth tank. When your drains are clogged, you will probably begin to discover gurgling sounds, water backing up into your sink or shower, or strange smells.
