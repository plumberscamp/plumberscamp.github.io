<p>Aside from these two important elements, there are a myriad of little, possibly less critical things that can break or deteriorate. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode far more rapidly. Constant gross smells coming from the toilet can suggest you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. You may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting appropriately. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank covers can split and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed. While this will not affect the function of your toilet, it definitely does not do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by pointing out all the important things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part needs to be in excellent shape for it to operate at its best.</p>
