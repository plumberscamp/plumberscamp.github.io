<p>3. Solar Salt comes from evaporated seawater and may in some cases leave a pink "bio-film" or stain in tubs and sinks. The pink movie is actually a safe bacteria that comes from the sea salt. If this stain is an inconvenience in your home, the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) suggests switching to among the other 2 types of salts. Once the brand-new salt has had a chance to totally replace the solar salt in your system, then acquire some water softener filter cleaner to clear out your softener as advised in your owner's handbook or on the cleaner label.</p>

Some fill toilet valves have a float adjustment screw on top (see Figure A listed below). Bend the float arm if there is no modification screw. Make sure it's changed correctly (Image 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You do not need to clear the tank to make these modifications.</p>
<p>Clear the trap: If the above techniques do not work, the next step would be to remove the P-trap under the sink. Place a pail underneath the area to capture water then loosen the 2 threaded caps that hold the curved section of the pipe in place. Nowadays, a lot of kitchen drains are made from white PVC pipe with connections that can be unscrewed by hand.</p>
