<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean water supply pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
