<h3>Emergency Plumber & 24 Hour Plumbing Services Haledon NJ</h3>
<p>The most efficient method to deal with tough water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When tough water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>This is very crucial! When you have actually cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet supplies to press the waste out of your drain system. Current policies limit the amount of water a toilet can utilize per flush to 1.28 gallons per flush which can leave particles piling up in cast iron drain lines. We provide two kinds of water treatment systems for difficult water: Advantage Series Salt Water Softeners and NaturSoft Â® Water Softener Alternatives.</p>
