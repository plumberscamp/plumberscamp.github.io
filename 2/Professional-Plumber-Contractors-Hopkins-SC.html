<p>Backflow implies the undesirable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable water supply; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a drinkable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they need to be thoroughly developed and set up to prevent backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>

If the current backflow is not up to District code, the correction needs to be made before water service is allowed. Cost for the device is covered by either the occupant or the residential or commercial property owner.</p>
