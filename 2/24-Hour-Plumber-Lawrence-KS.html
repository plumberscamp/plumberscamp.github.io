When the resin beads have actually maxed out their capability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a procedure called regeneration). During this procedure, the resin beads are washed with the extremely focused saltwater option (brine) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank). The salt water forces the calcium and magnesium ions to be launched from the beads and replaced with sodium or potassium ions.</p>
