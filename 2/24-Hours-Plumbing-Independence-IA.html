<h3>Clogged Drains Driving You Crazy Never Call The Emergency Plumber Again Independence IA</h3>
<p>These people were fantastic! They appeared early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue off and on for years now. It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never ever drained this well. I chose this company due to the fact that they had fantastic evaluations and a reasonable price, and although the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a huge, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a great job tidying up after it too.</p>
