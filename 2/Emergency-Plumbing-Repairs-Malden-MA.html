Homes integrated in the first part of the 1900s were plumbed utilizing lead pipes. At that time, people had no concept that the lead in the pipes could leach into the drinking water, not to mention the health hazards related to lead.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are normally the result of wood rot. The flange screws merely won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best solution depends on the extent of the rot. Utilize an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Before you install this type of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
<p>Everyone who's set up a couple of disposals understands this error: Forgetting to get rid of the dishwasher knockout before hanging the system. Running water: If the toilet runs even when it hasn't been recently used and you've replaced the flapper, the problem might be bigger than it appears. The tank eventually loses its ability to seal correctly, developing waste and a greater water expense.</p>
