<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at as much as 3,500 PSI. This enables the sewer lines to be cleaned quickly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure.

<p>However, the majority of the time, it's safe to state that any repairs that need to be completed will come out of the wallet of a homeowner. Plumbing Codes and State law determine minimum requirements for backflow prevention. Public water systems such as the City Utilities Department should meet or go beyond the state standards and carry the obligation for enforcing them.</p>
<p>The source or location of a sewer problem determines who pays for repair. The City is responsible for the general public right of way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another. The homeowner is accountable for the area from the curb to the back of their home line. Easements (typically 10 feet large) where main sewers traverse private property are an exception to this rule.</p>
<p>It is very important that all elements of your gas lines are in good condition. The state of the pipe is very important. As is the connection to your appliance and equipment. If any of these are a concern, there is the capacity for gas leakages and even fire. When a Notification of Correction" or Notice of Requirement" is provided, failure to install or correct an installation and then check a backflow assembly may lead to service disruption or termination.</p>
