<p>Your kitchen sink is an important part of your house, which makes its plumbing's efficient working a need more than a need. Once the test results reveal the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated during the repair process. It is essential that the plumbing system be turned on really gradually to assure no damage is done to the piping system. As soon as the system is pressurized, air should be eliminated from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system must be checked to guarantee no valves were unintentionally exposed or did not close appropriately when re-pressurized. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are totally open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has actually been gone back to service.</p>
