<p>Once the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and examined and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some elements may have really tight tolerances that have to be maintained. An essential thing to determine on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the element. The guide is a very vital part of the design of each element. If the element is not repaired correctly, the guide could restrict the movement (instead of consistent or direct) of the component, which might cause the part to not work to its abilities. Often times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are restricting the travel of the element triggering lower test results than what is required.</p>
