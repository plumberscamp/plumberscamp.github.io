<p>A backflow preventer is a means or system to prevent backflow. The standard means of avoiding backflow is an air space, which either removes a cross-connection or supplies a barrier to backflow. The fundamental system for avoiding backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which provides a physical barrier to backflow. The principal types of mechanical backflow preventers are the reduced-pressure principle assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the double check valve assembly.</p>
