We advise natural products, such as Bio-Clean, since they work much better than products consisting of extreme chemicals and won't trigger damage to your drains or components.</p>
<p>The part expenses around $14 per drip leg, and you may be able to install it yourself as a Do It Yourself project. You will not have water spots. Tough water leaves water spots on dishes, glasses, and utensils whether you are washing them by hand or in a dishwasher. Soft water takes care of this by reducing the minerals in the water.

Tough minerals caught in the resin (or zeolite) are launched and the media gets replenished with salt ions. The water softener is likewise cleaned up and sanitized throughout regeneration.
