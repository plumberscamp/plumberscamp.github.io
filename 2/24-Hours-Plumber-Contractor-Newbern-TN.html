<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and a great person. He informed me exactly what to expect (cost, time, procedure) in advance and delivered as guaranteed. I will absolutely utilize Clog Dawg once again. Setting up a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with an average per hour rate of $25 to $70. These rates remain in addition to the cost of the disposal unit. The overall you pay may be greater if your plumber has a minimum callout cost that is greater than the labor cost for the work.</p>
<p>The source or area of a sewer problem identifies who pays for repair. The City is responsible for the general public right of way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another. The homeowner is accountable for the area from the curb to the back of their residential or commercial property line. Easements (typically 10 feet large) where main sewers pass through private property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
