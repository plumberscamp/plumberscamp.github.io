<p>Determining if you need a water softener is a personal choice. Water softener systems work by getting rid of solidity minerals and replacing them with sodium ions. Water conditioners are gadgets that help prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale.

Due to the fact that water conditioners utilize a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are often considered a greener option in locations where it is forbidden to utilize salt. Water conditioners do not effectively get rid of hardness from the water supply, however, as the only way to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
