<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water supply pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in drinkable supply of water pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
<p>When installed, these BPAs are subject to periodic and initial testing and maintenance requirements to verify their continued functional efficiency. Such testing should be carried out by a state licensed Back-flow Prevention Assemble Tester signed up with the City of Austin.

Professional drain cleaning with cleanouts is much more efficient at getting rid of clogs. Lots of houses have drain cleanouts, however, we come across older homes without cleanouts.
