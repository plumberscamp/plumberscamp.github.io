The best way to clear a clogged drain without harming your pipes and plumbing system is to get in touch with a trusted local plumber at ABC. The pipe that links your sink to the main supply, contains water at high pressures. A leak in this unit will be right away visible. The defected part will either spray or drip a lot, depending upon the damage.</p>
