If the area is thought about a confined area, proper safety precautions must be followed for correct entry. A safe and correct work environment might involve the placement of security barricades or entry restrictions around the work area so the repair technician or the public around your work area are not harmed. This could impact the specialist's capability to successfully finish the repair if the backflow preventer is installed in a limiting area.</p>
