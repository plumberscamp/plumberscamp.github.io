Houses built in the first part of the 1900s were plumbed utilizing lead pipes. At that time, people had no idea that the lead in the pipes could leach into the drinking water, not to mention the health hazards associated with lead.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are generally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws merely will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best service depends on the extent of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into company wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this kind of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
<p>Your waste disposal unit guarantees that your sink and plumbing fixtures don't get clogged. Contrary to some people's understanding, garbage disposals do not include blades. Instead, a garbage disposal features two stationary bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk. When the disposal is turned on the disks quickly spin, and these bolts force food and particles to grind against a stationary mill along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action successfully crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without blocking.</p>
