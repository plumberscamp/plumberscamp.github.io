Because of the age of the home and area of the pipe, it was a tough job. They worked for almost 12 hours into darkness to make certain the system was working prior to they left. I am really grateful for their hard work and professionalism.</p>

A garbage disposal works by shredding the waste into small pieces that are capable of taking a trip through the sewage pipes without restraining water flow. By setting up a waste disposal unit you are assisting the environment by saving the quantity of trash that gets sent out to land fills and other disposing areas. With a waste disposal unit the trash is handled through currently existing water facilities.</p>
