Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they must be carefully designed and installed to prevent backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
