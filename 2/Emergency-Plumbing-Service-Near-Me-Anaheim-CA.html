<p>In this circumstance, dirty water from the hillside pool will back- siphon or back-flow down the hosepipe and into the clean water tank. You likewise need to purchase a backflow valve if you observe your water has an uncommon circulation, color, taste or odor. A plumbing professional can determine whether the issue with your faucet is a quick fix or the outcome of other problems in your house's plumbing system. More complex problems with water temperature or pressure may need replacing the hot water heater, which normally costs $350-$ 3,500, depending on capacity and type.</p>
<p>The individual who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not needed to acquire this certification. I've contacted a few plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing ranged from $150 - $250, however I would anticipate the rate to be significantly less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
