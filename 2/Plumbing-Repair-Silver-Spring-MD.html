The repair may be as easy as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates data on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to know what the field test data means for that particular assembly.  When a trained tester analyzes the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
