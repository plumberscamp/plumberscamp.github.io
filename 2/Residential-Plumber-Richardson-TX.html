If your house was developed before the 1970s, we strongly recommend that you work with a plumbing professional to check your home's plumbing and check if there are areas that need repiping. Chances are that your home might need extensive repiping so that your home's plumbing can work at optimum rates if your home was developed years prior to that.</p>
