For an outdoor gas light or home appliance whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can trigger a clog or can cause deterioration that blocks the line. Simply 4" of water pressure can be enough to obstruct a natural gas line. Noise-- In time sediment can build up in the bottom of your tank. This sediment eventually gets tough and removes from the capability of your hot water heater. This solidified sediment is likely the source of the noise.</p>
