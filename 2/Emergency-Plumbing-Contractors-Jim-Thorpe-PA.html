<p>You reside in an older house. If your home is 50 years old or older and you've never ever changed its pipes, there's a great chance that you'll need to have it done quickly. Galvanized pipes were usually installed in homes of this age, and these types of pipes are known to rust and burst when they get old. If so, you might need to add a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you do not already have one. This generally adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the general cost of the waste disposal unit installation.</p>
<p>In the meantime, however, we recommend you first shot using non-harsh and non-abrasive white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Merely pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, include some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. If that doesn't work, you can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. Much of these cleaners contain focused levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be really hazardous if it comes in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. Please make certain to take the appropriate preventative measures if utilizing among these items.</p>
