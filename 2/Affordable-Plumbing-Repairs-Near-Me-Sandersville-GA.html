<p>An overall repipe of a house's water supply, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most pricey and elaborate plumbing job, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on entire home repiping. Current Review: Carlos and Lopez were remarkable. My 90 year old Daddy's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos arrived at 8am the next day to repair. Due to the fact that of the age of the home and location of the pipe, it was a challenging task. They worked for nearly 12 hours into darkness to make certain the system was working before they left. I am really grateful for their effort and professionalism.</p>
