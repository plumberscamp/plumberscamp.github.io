<p>The U-shaped pipe beneath bathroom and kitchen sinks is something that individuals expect to see but seldom stop to consider.

<p>Button Plumbing was great. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the previous. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was rather sensible. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely happy with their service.</p>
