<p>Figuring out if you need a water softener is a personal choice. Water softener systems work by eliminating solidity minerals and changing them with sodium ions. Water conditioners are gadgets that help prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to prevent the scale from building up by neutralizing the firmness itself. Due to the truth that water conditioners use a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are in some cases considered a greener alternative in locations where it is forbidden to use salt. Water conditioners do not successfully remove hardness from the water supply, however, as the only way to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>

<p>The next requirements to assess is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is very important that the repair professional knows the appropriate installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to make sure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly need to be set up in the installation orientation for which it was approved. The majority of backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, but it is necessary that the assembly only be installed if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work correctly and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work since the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
