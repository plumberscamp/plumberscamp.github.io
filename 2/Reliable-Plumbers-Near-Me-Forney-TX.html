<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming safe and clean water system. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage happens when negative or decreased pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity.
