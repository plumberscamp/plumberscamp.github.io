<p>Your house's drainage works by the basic force of gravity. When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets too) it's not truly the circulation of water pressing them down your pipes. Rather, once they go down your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. Anything you put down there will not go through when something obstructs the pipes.</p>
