Trenchless pipe repair is a type of pipe repair that does not include any excavation. Trenchless pipe repair also known as trenchless pipe lining is a exceptional and durable  choice for your damaged pipes. The pipe lining process involves our team saturating a felt liner with an unique resin mix. When the felt liner is completely saturated, it is pressed through your pipeline. As the liner moves through your pipes, it coats the interior walls, sealing all imperfections and fractures. The liner is left to harden in location for a number of hours or 60 minutes if heat is utilized. When the process is total, the liner will be eliminated and your pipe will be examined one more time to ensure your brand-new pipe is set within your existing one.</p>
