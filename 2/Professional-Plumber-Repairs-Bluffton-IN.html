<p>Brine Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Features automated shut-off to avoid overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is likely from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or natural gas is extremely low. Rainwater which has actually not filtered through the earth is an extremely pure type of water. When water evaporates it leaves liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. Therefore when evaporated water eventually falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
<p>When a gas line is burst, it right away becomes a major security risk. Without being fixed as rapidly as possible, it might cause quite a bit of damage if the gas inside ends up being ignited. If a person recognizes that they have burst a gas line, the very first concern is to switch off the supply of natural gas and call the utility company.</p>

The very best strainers have either a spin-lock or a twist-and-drop design stopper. The spin-lock stopper doesn't have any parts that can use, but screwing it in and out can be annoying. The twist-and-drop style is a lot easier to use but requires occasional -ring replacement.</p>
