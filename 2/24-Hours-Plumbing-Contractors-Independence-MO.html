<p>When the components are positioned back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is all set to be pressurized. It is necessary to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the downside shut off remains in the closed position. This enables the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in a precise movement. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any accumulated air needs to be removed from the body. A lot of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from vital areas in the assembly. In some designs, test dicks can be used to remove air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a place where the air will accumulate.</p>
<p>If you see nothing apparent, insert the wrench into the motor spline, found at the bottom of the unit, and twist best and left.
