<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer kit will be connected to the disposer using the plate, gasket and screws originally planned for the disposer discharge elbow. If your set just consists of a waste arm, it is possible - though not recommended - to connect this to the disposer discharge elbow using a slip joint. The consecutive 90 Â° turns in such a setup can result in inappropriate drainage. Depending upon the length of the waste arm, you might have the ability to cut off its elbow and use the rest as a straight discharge tube.</p>
