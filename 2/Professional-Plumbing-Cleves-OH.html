This might suggest that the water doesn't have a clear path to do through, most likely because of a blocked drain. This is also the best time to add the cable and plug to your disposal. It's actually uncomfortable to add these after you have actually completed this how to install a garbage disposal task.</p>
<p>In some cases, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as basic as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates data on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to know what the field test information indicates for that specific assembly.  When a qualified tester translates the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
