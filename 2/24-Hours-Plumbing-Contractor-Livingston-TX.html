<p>Odd Sounds - If unusual gurgling is originating from your drain, it probably needs an extensive cleaning. When food or waste clog your drains, it makes it difficult for the water to pass through. The pipes often make weird gurgling sounds as water efforts to pass through a clogged pipe since of the tight space. This triggers the water to bubble, as only little pockets of air are available, leading to the weird noises originating from your sink.</p>
<p>If you hear water running in your toilet and you think a leaky toilet tank or toilet bowl, try this: spray a couple of drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and let the toilet sit for about half an hour. After 30 minutes, check to see if any of the water in your toilet bowl has changed color. If it has, you more than likely have a leak.</p>
<p>Among the things we concentrate on is the bathroom toilet. So many people and services let the toilet waste water every year with leaking or ineffective designs. This is cash and a natural resource running down the drain. Water conservation in the desert is important and older toilets can utilize 3.5 gallons of water per flush!
