<p>In addition to water softening systems, Rinckey stated that reverse osmosis systems (ROs) are rather popular with property owners in the area. He kept in mind that there are specific pollutants that citizens are dealing with and an RO can help minimize those problems. Due to being largely farming in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some property owners are installing ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are an item of farming waste. Rinckey kept in mind that these systems get rid of around 94 percent of nitrates. Arsenic likewise naturally occurs in some soils which too can be treated with the right RO system.</p>

Easements (usually 10 feet broad) where main sewers traverse personal property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
