<p>If a gas water heater or an electric system is more affordable, property owners frequently ask. The response depends on your home.

<p>House water softeners, likewise called ion exchange systems, are home appliances that eliminate calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. Once the resin beads end up being filled with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium solution removes the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride service ends up being a waste stream that decreases the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
