<p>The secret to preventing a clogged garbage disposal is moderation. As long as the food waste is sent through the disposal at an affordable amount, there must be no concern in getting the majority of the waste through. There are a couple of food products you must most likely not put into the garbage disposal though. Those items are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another suggestion to stop blocking is to watch out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will solidify when they cool so it is best to wash pots and pans that have those liquids under hot water and to continue to let the water run for several seconds after you are completed cleaning to ensure the drain is clear.</p>
