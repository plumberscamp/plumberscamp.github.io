<p>Organic particles, such as grease, food, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's cable, snake or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's DIY task. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it's worth it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
<p>All faucets and valves in your house need to be routinely worked out to keep them from freezing in place. For example, a single handle shower valve may end up being mineralized and calcified causing it to not function properly when called upon. Similar to you and me, routine exercise keeps our bodies functioning at a higher level than if we sat doing nothing every day. Anderson Plumbing, Heating and Air can visit your home, inspect the valves throughout your home, and encourage you of any alternatives or possible repairs that need to be considered now or in the future. When visitors show up or having to call a plumber, an ounce of prevention can imply the difference in between having a functioning shower valve in the spare bathroom.</p>
