<p>Once the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and inspected and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some parts may have really tight tolerances that need to be maintained. A crucial thing to identify on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the component. The guide is a very critical part of the style of each component. If the component is not repaired correctly, the guide might limit the movement (rather than consistent or direct) of the element, which might cause the element to not work to its capabilities. Often times springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are limiting the travel of the element causing lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>

<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of one or more afflicted areas of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to just abandon the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost really rapidly.
