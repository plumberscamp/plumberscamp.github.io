However, they include another layer of security that makes them basically sure by also locating a hydraulically operated differential relief valve below the very first check valve.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the past. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was rather reasonable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly delighted with their service.</p>
