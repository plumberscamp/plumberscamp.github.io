<p>There are various causes for obstructions depending on where they take place in your plumbing Toilets clog from excessive bathroom tissue for the many part. When the toilet tissue gathers in the sewer pipe leading from the toilet rather of streaming through it, the toilet will not flush. The water only back up in the bowl. There are times when our plumber needs to eliminate the toilet to unclog the drain correctly.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are typically the result of wood rot. The flange screws just will not keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best solution depends on the extent of the rot. Utilize an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Prior to you install this sort of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
