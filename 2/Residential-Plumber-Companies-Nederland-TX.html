<p>Backflow means the undesirable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the safe and clean supply of water; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from happening. Points at which a potable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they must be carefully designed and installed to prevent backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
