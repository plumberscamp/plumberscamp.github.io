Some house owners will attempt to dislodge the clog utilizing store-bought drain cleaners and natural home remedies, like vinegar or lemon juice with baking soda. These treatments do work, specifically if you are handling a little drain clog. Nevertheless, they are normally momentary fixes that do not use long-term resolutions.</p>
