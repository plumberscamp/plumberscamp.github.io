Under the sink, put a pail or pan below the waste pipe, then use locking-jaw pliers or a monkey wrench to detach the old disposal's tailpiece from the drain line's drain. To loosen the nut, turn it counterclockwise.</p>
<p>Your house's drainage works by the basic force of gravity. When you flush water and squander down your sink or shower (and your toilets too) it's not really the flow of water pressing them down your pipes.

<h3>Plumbing, Drains & Water Cleanup Henderson KY</h3>
<p>These people were remarkable! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem off and on for years now. It was installed 7 years earlier, and it never ever drained this well. I selected this company since they had terrific evaluations and a fair cost, and despite the fact that the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a substantial, revolting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a terrific task tidying up after it too.</p>
