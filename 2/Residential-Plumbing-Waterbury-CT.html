<p>Clark's Process: This procedure is also called lime softening. The chemical calcium hydroxide, called limewater, is added to water, which triggers the solidity ions to speed up. The alkalinity of the water is raised through this addition to above 9.6, so carbon dioxide should be contributed to re-carbonate the water and bring the pH pull back. When it concerns pipe repair, the most expensive elements aren't the machinery or materials utilized, but the landscaping, yard and uprooting damage that ensues.</p>
<p>Renovation plumbers usually charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Again, this doesn't include the cost of parts. However more and more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their bids are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly spend much more. With this approach, you know the turnkey price entering into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's duty, not yours.</p>
