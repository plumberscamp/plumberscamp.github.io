<p>As soon as the elements are positioned back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is all set to be pressurized. It is necessary to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the downside shut down stays in the closed position.

A lot of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from crucial areas in the assembly.
