<p>If your assembly fails the yearly test, you are accountable for changing the assembly or repairing within one month. All replacements must be installed to Manatee County Utilities Standards and be the right kind of assembly based on the conditions on your residential or commercial property (see section listed below "Needed Backflow Prevention Assemblies") In addition, the assembly must fulfill the lead totally free requirement of Section 1417 of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300g-6) If you are still out of compliance after the 30 days, all water services will be ceased till the assembly remains in compliance.</p>
