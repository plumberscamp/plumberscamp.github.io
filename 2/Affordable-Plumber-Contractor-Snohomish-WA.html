<p>Backflow Preventers are an important element of any plumbing job with the function of keeping drinkable water different from any prospective hazards through various applications. We provide a range of types of Backflow Preventers, including Decreased Pressure Zone (RPZ) Assemblies, Vacuum Breakers, Dual Checks, and Check Valve Assemblies, together with accompanying test enclosures, valves, and kits.</p>
<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the inbound potable water system. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when negative or reduced pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common kind of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
