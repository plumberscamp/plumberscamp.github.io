<h3>Emergency Plumbing Service And Maintenance Wakefield MA</h3>
<p>The most effective way to resolve difficult water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When difficult water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and changed with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Softer clothing without difficult minerals trapped in the fabric. Fabrics last longer and whites remain whiter without the dingy gray caused by hard water. We are a premier plumbing company all set to service all of your plumbing needs. We provide a range of specials so you never have to pay more. The temperature and pressure relief valve is a safety device that restricts tank pressure and keeps it from exploding (Image 4). A brand-new one should be consisted of with every installation.
