<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the difficult water is softened. The water system line feeds the difficult water into the tank. The water leaks through the bed of resin beads, depositing the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and flows through your pipes and out to your household home appliances. Backflow is a term utilized in the plumbing world to describe an unfavorable circulation of water in the reverse instructions. The backflow of water carries impurities back to the primary supply of water system, making the water in it hazardous to consume.</p>
