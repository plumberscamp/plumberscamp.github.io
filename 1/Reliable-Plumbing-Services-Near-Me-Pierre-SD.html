<p>Nearly all softeners fall into one of two categories. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on a predetermined schedule and then return to service. Due to the fact that they regrow whether the resin needs it or not, these work well for families that are on routine water-using cycles but will lose more water and salt. Demand-control designs, with either mechanical and electrical sensing units, generally regrow after many gallons of water have actually been softened. If you have an ever-changing water utilize schedule, such models are practical.</p>
