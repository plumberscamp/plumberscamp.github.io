The choice "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of personal preference not requirement. However, water softening does have advantages, and downsides, that make this decision a considerable one.</p>
<p>Toilets are hard things to know. They have actually been constructed practically the very same method for centuries, so you can't really tell how old they are. It might not work extremely well all the time, but you can't inform if that's regular or not.
