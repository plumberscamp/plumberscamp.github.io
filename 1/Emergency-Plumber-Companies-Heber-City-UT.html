<p>As a locally-owned business, stability and duty are exceptionally crucial to constructing a track record for quality. Area 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of isolation backflow preventers (BFP) and Section 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses security of the drinkable water system within a structure these gadgets are referred to as seclusion" BFP. Once again, the very best kind of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would stream over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to make sure there is an air gap, if there is no way to offer one, then we inspect to see that the appropriate BFP device is installed. These BFP's, if testable, are needed to be tested (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and a minimum of every twelve months thereafter.</p>
