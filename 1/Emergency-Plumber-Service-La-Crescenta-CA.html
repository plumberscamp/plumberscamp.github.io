<p>These men were fantastic! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem on and off for many years now. It was installed 7 years ago, and it never drained this well. I chose this company because they had great reviews and a reasonable price, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a big, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did a great job cleaning up after it too.</p>
