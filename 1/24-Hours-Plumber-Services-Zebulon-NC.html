<p>A. Typically wax does not "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undiscovered issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
<p>If you have an older house, there's a great chance you have galvanized pipes. And if your house was built in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are probably nearing the end of their life expectancy. As galvanized pipes age, they begin to wear away. This deterioration can lead to a buildup of lead, which can have numerous negative impacts on your health. Rusty pipes also result in bad water quality and low water pressure.</p>
