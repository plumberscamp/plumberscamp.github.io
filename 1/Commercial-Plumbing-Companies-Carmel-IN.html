Points at which a safe and clean water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they need to be carefully developed and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
