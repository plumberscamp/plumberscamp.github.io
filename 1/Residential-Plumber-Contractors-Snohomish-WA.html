Trenchless pipe repair is a form of pipe repair that does not include any excavation.

The pipe lining process involves our team saturating a felt liner with a special resin mix. It is pushed through your pipeline when the felt liner is totally filled. As the liner moves through your pipes, it coats the interior walls, sealing all fractures and flaws. If heat is used, the liner is left to solidify in place for a number of hours or 60 minutes. Once the process is total, the liner will be gotten rid of and your pipe will be inspected one more time to make certain your new pipe is set within your existing one.</p>
