<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned up and examined and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some elements might have really tight tolerances that have to be kept. An important thing to recognize on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the part. The guide is a very critical part of the style of each part. If the element is not repaired effectively, the guide could restrict the movement (rather than direct or constant) of the part, which might trigger the part to not work to its abilities. Many times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are limiting the travel of the part causing lower test results than what is required.</p>
