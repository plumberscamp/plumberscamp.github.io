Points at which a drinkable water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they need to be carefully developed and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
