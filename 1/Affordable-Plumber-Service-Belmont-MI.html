<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water supply pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in safe and clean water system pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>
