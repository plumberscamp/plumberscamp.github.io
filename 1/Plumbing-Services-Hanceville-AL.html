The repair might be as basic as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates information on the operations of the assembly.
