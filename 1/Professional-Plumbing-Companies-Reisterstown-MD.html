<p>As soon as the hardware parts have been cleaned and examined and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some elements may have extremely tight tolerances that need to be maintained. An essential thing to recognize on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the part. The guide is a very critical part of the design of each component. If the part is not fixed appropriately, the guide could limit the movement (instead of direct or stable) of the component, which might cause the part to not work to its capabilities. Often times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. For the most part the guides are restricting the travel of the element causing lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>
