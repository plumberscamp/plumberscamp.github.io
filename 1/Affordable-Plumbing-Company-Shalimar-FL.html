<p>A total repipe of a house's water system, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most complex and costly plumbing job, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on whole house repiping.

Due to the fact that of the age of the house and area of the pipe, it was a difficult job. They worked for almost 12 hours into darkness to make certain the system was working before they left. I am genuinely grateful for their effort and professionalism.</p>
