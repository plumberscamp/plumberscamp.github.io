<p>A reduced pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is installed in high risk" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has two spring checks, however likewise has a third check valve that is actually a vent open to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is utilized in high-risk scenarios is due to the fact that if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve uses an additional layer of protection compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the factor that when you evaluate an RPZ, you require water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
