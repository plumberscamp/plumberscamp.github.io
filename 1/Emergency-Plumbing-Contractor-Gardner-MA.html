<p>Nevertheless, you also need to think about the age of your system.

<p>Sometimes, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as basic as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces information on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to know what the field test data suggests for that specific assembly.  When a qualified tester analyzes the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
