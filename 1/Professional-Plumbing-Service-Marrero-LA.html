<p>Note: Hard water stops your washing cleaning agent from working efficiently because tough water ions can bond with cleaning agent particles to deactivate them. You, therefore, need to use more and more cleaning agent to accomplish the same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt solution. Tough minerals caught in the resin (or zeolite) are launched and the media gets renewed with sodium ions. The water softener is also cleaned and disinfected during regeneration. Finally, water including the difficult minerals and other waste gets flushed out of the system.</p>
