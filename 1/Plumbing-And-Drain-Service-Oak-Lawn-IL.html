<p>Viking SupplyNet's comprehensive stock of backflow valves and associated devices consists of leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public supply of water respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and become fragile. This leads to micro-fractures and decreases the standard structural stability of the system. The system ends up being weak and may stop working without warning, causing damage to the building structure and personal effects. Inappropriate installation is also a typical cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly impossible to find.</p>
<p>City of Bellingham examines backflow assemblies upon installation and performs routine re-inspections on all existing assemblies. New assemblies should be checked by a State of Washington certified Backflow Assembly Tester prior to taking into service. A copy of the test report should be provided to the City of Bellingham.

<p>This is a bad indication. Toilets must definitely never wobble, shift, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. If you can move a toilet around by doing anything less extreme than swinging a sledgehammer at it, that toilet should be replaced. Improperly seated and sealed toilets could leak, damage plumbing, or even jeopardize the structural integrity of the home.</p>
