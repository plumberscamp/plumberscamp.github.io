<p>Brine Valve - Controls water flow in and out of salt tank. Features automatic shut-off to prevent overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is likely from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or gas is extremely low. Rainwater which has not infiltrated the earth is a remarkably pure form of water. When water vaporizes it leaves behind liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. Therefore when vaporized water eventually falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
