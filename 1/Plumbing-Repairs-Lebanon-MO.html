The water is constantly warmed as long as the tap remains on. If the tap is instantly turned off, the water stops being heated. The heating temperature level is generally pre-set to fit your choices and needs. Tankless electrical water heaters use less power than conventional water heaters since they just heat water when needed.</p>

<p>Brine Valve - Controls water flow in and out of salt tank. Features automatic shut-off to prevent overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is likely from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or gas is extremely low. Rainwater which has not infiltrated the earth is a remarkably pure form of water. When water vaporizes it leaves behind liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. Therefore when vaporized water eventually falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
