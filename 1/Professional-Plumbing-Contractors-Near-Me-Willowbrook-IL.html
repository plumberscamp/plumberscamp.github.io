<p>A reduced pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is installed in high threat" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but also has a third check valve that is in fact a vent open up to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is utilized in high-risk situations is due to the fact that if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve uses an additional layer of defense compared to the DC, which will enable backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the factor that when you check an RPZ, you force water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
