<p>A. Usually wax doesn't "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undetected issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
<p>Re-piping is a process of changing the water supply pipes in a house or structure. It is a total replacement of your supply plumbing system. Repiping is a process of setting up a new water line plumbing system. This procedure usually consists of eliminating old easily accessible pipes and then setting up the new plumbing system. Requirement repiping tasks consist of installation of all brand-new hot and cold domestic water piping from the water source to all existing fixtures and faucets.

A pump used to increase the water pressure within a building's plumbing system to reach a higher floor may trigger this. Preventive cleaning for drains must be performed on all drains, including toilet, floor, tub and sink drains.</p>
