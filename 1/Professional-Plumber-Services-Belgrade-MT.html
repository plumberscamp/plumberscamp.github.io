<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on.
