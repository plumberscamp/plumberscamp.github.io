<p>The individual who does the testing must be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not required to get this accreditation.

<h3>Gas Pipe Installation in Carrollton Texas</h2>

As soon as you accept move forward, the installation can start. This typically just takes a few hours, but if there are unpredicted scenarios, your service provider may need to return the following day.</p>
