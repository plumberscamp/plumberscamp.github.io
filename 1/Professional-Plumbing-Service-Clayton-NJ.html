<p>If pressure is lost, a backflow preventer stops water inside your water pipes from flowing back to the City system. Backflow can pollute the water system. The standard system for avoiding backflow is a mechanical backflow prevention device, which provides a physical barrier to backflow. All leaks, worn fittings, and other plumbing problems will be fixed.</p>
<p>The most common method for producing soft water is through ion exchange, a process in which the calcium and magnesium in the water are exchanged for another element, normally sodium. Sodium won't trigger lime scale or soap scum buildup like other minerals do, and water softening includes only a very percentage of salt to your water.
