<p>Your house's drainage works by the basic force of gravity. When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets also) it's not actually the circulation of water pushing them down your pipes. Rather, once they go down your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. When something blocks the pipes, anything you pour down there won't go through.</p>

<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in drinkable supply of water pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
