<p>Backflow is bad news. The harsh water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are tough on water pipes. Over an amount of time the inside lining of the pipe will weaken and a small pinhole leak will develop. In some cases the service is to repair the damaged area of pipe, and an area repair is all that is required to resolve the issue. Other times a more comprehensive service is required: repiping.</p>
<p>No warm water-- The absence of warm water is the most significant sign that there is something wrong with your San Antonio water heater. If you aren't getting sufficient hot water for your shower, then you might have sediment that has built up in the system and separated the water from the heat source.

<p>Your home's drainage works by the basic force of gravity. When you flush water and squander down your sink or shower (and your toilets too) it's not truly the circulation of water pushing them down your pipes. Instead, once they go down your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. When something obstructs the pipes, anything you pour down there won't go through.</p>
