If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising correctly, you might need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. Tank covers can break and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed if mishandled. While this will not impact the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom.
