<p>Sewer linings can help to repair broken pipes without having to totally replace your sewer lines or damage the area around them. Lots of property owners avoid repiping their homes due to the fact that it is a big task that is often perceived as an unnecessary expense. Why repipe your house when fixing it is possible?

In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to just abandon the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost very quickly.
