<p>You count on your drains to carry wastewater from your shower, sink or tub. In time, the drains end up being clogged with residue such as mineral sediment, food, hair, grease and more. These products gather in the drain and ultimately harden versus the pipe walls, making them tough to remove.

If a water main were to break or if the fire department opened a number of fire hydrants to assist battle a fire, the pressure in the water main might drop. The need upstream could trigger a reversal in flow.</p>
<p>Waste disposal unit systems may cost more when they have to fit local water and sewer capacities. The plumbing in your home need to work well or backup can occur, and septic systems may need to be upgraded to deal with the disposal. Baffles: Baffles avoid silverware from going into the waste disposal unit, so you're only sending food and compostable waste down the drain.</p>
