Once the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are totally open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has been gone back to service.</p>

<p>Deluge systems are designed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems typically are set up in locations where the possibility of an extreme fire condition is likely, such as aircraft garages. Water to the system is held back by the deluge valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire happens, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then permits water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
