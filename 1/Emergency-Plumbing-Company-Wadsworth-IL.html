<p>When looking for a gas line installation in Dallas, therefore, you need to utilize well-trained and certified experts for all elements of your plumbing and gas line installation. Once your plumber has set up a gas line, you'll want an audit of the plumbing and installation to guarantee that there are no gas leakages. This must be done before the plumber leaves the task. The audit will reduce the possibilities of a gas leak. If you do notice a pungent smell in your house after your plumber leaves, shut down the gas valves immediately. Evacuate the structure and guarantee that open fire does not get close to your house up until a professional can fix the gas leak. Contact your gas utility company immediately.</p>
