Check to see if there is an accumulation of mineral deposits in the tank, if possible. Mineral deposits can choose the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will indicate that less water will be warmed and available for use. Likewise, rust of the tank's components can cause the tank to have a short life. If the hot water heater is old or you see obvious indications of deterioration, request that a brand-new one be set up.</p>
