<p>If a gas water heater or an electric system is more cost-effective, house owners often ask. The response depends upon your home. While gas models are less costly to run, they do need an existing natural gas line. The price of an electric hot water heater is usually lower, but it can be more expensive to operate. Electric ranges are likewise simpler to install, and unlike gas systems, they are less most likely to lose heat.</p>
<p>Tank to Tank installation: Typically, replacing a gas or electrical water tank with a similar design takes two to three hours. It takes in between 45 to 60 minutes to drain, detach and remove your old water heater.

<p>Another typical argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves ought to prevent backflow.  The apparent issue with this is that if the backflow takes place at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic manually run valve ought to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if completely closed, has good seals, and does not leak.  However most of the automated valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves utilized for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and fully closed.</p>
