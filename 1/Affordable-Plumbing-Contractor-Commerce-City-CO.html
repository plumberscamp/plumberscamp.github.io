<p>The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania currently has no licensure or accreditation requirements for most construction contractors (or their workers).

This technology is more cost effective and lasts longer than typical water softening items such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>
<p>In many cases, a natural gas line may be covered if it is ruptured.

In addition, if a rupture is produced by an energy company, it may be covered. The sediment trap parts cost $10 to $14 each and plumbers will have the ability to install it within an hour.</p>
