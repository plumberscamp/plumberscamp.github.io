<p>Deluge systems are developed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems generally are installed in areas where the possibility of a severe fire condition is likely, such as airplane hangars. Water to the system is kept back by the deluge valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire occurs, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then enables water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>

<p>Galvanized steel safe and clean water system and distribution pipes are typically discovered with nominal pipe sizes from 3⁄8 inch (9.5 mm) to 2 inches (51 mm). It is hardly ever utilized today for brand-new building and construction residential plumbing. Steel pipe has National Pipe Thread (NPT) standard tapered male threads, which connect with female tapered threads on elbows, tees, couplers, valves, and other fittings. Galvanized steel (frequently recognized merely as "galv" or "iron" in the plumbing trade) is relatively expensive, and challenging to deal with due to weight and requirement of a pipe threader It remains in common use for repair of existing "galv" systems and to satisfy building code non-combustibility requirements generally discovered in hotels, apartment buildings and other commercial applications. It is also very durable and resistant to mechanical abuse. Black lacquered steel pipe is the most extensively used pipe material for fire sprinklers and gas.</p>
