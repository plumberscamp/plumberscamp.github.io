<p>Loose flanges are usually the result of wood rot. The flange screws just will not keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best service depends upon the degree of the rot.

Prior to you install this sort of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>
