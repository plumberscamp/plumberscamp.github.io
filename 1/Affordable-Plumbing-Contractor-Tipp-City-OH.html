He also did the job faster than initial approximated, so the work was less costly than I expected. I will utilize Gotelli Plumbing once again in the future.</p>
<p>You need to invest a minimum of $50 to get a top quality kitchen sink basket strainer assembly with a resilient surface and a reliable stopper mechanism. The very best strainers have either a spin-lock or a twist-and-drop design stopper. The spin-lock stopper does not have any parts that can wear, however screwing it in and out can be frustrating. The twist-and-drop style is a lot easier to use but needs occasional -ring replacement.</p>
