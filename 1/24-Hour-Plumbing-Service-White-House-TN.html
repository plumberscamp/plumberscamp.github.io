<p>Letters are sent to residential customers with known backflow gadgets on a yearly basis. The City's plumbing code needs a backflow preventer on all landscape irrigation systems, pool, and hot tubs. Turn the disposal unit to align the discharge tailpiece with the drain trap, and then connect it. Relying on the existing trap configuration, you might need to replace some or all of the drain piping beneath the sink to accommodate the disposal.</p>
<p>We have an inspection program to recognize water sources and situations that require backflow prevention devices. For residential property, it is necessary for owners to notify the District if any modifications are made, such as digging a brand-new well. For commercial home, the District reviews the use of each brand-new renter. The correction should be made before water service is allowed if the present backflow is not up to District code. Cost for the device is covered by either the tenant or the residential or commercial property owner.</p>
