<p>Backflow is bad news. The extreme water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are tough on water pipes. Over an amount of time the within lining of the pipe will degrade and a small pinhole leak will develop.

<h3>No Hot Water - No Problem, Fix it Yourself in Baldwin NY 11510!</h3>
<p>Backflow means the unwanted turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the drinkable supply of water; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from happening. Points at which a drinkable water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, however they must be carefully designed and installed to avoid backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
