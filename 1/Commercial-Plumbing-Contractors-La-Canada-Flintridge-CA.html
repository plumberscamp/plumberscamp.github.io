<p>A lowered pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is set up in high risk" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has 2 spring checks, however likewise has a third check valve that is really a vent available to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk scenarios is because if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens.
