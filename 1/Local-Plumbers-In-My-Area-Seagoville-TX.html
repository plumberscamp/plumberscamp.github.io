It is very important that you contact a qualified plumber if there is a relentless sewage smell in your house. Raw sewage is really harmful and can position serious health dangers.</p>
<p>If you hear water running in your toilet and you think a leaky toilet tank or toilet bowl, attempt this: squirt a couple of drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and let the toilet sit for about half an hour. After thirty minutes, check to see if any of the water in your toilet bowl has actually changed color. You most likely have a leak if it has.</p>
