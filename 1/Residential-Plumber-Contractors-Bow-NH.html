<h3>Why Plumbers Are So Expensive Bow NH</h3>
<p>These guys were fantastic! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem off and on for years now. It was installed 7 years ago, and it never ever drained this well. I selected this company since they had terrific reviews and a reasonable cost, and despite the fact that the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did an excellent job cleaning up after it as well.</p>
<p>Domestic water that gets here to your Ohio house carries minerals that can trigger rust on metal parts and elements. To avoid rust from rust, storage tanks are equipped with a bar made with magnesium called an anode rod. The rod protects the tank by drawing in harmful products. By having the anode rod inspected frequently and replaced as required, you can double the life of your hot water heater.</p>
