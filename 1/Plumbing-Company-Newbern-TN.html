<h3>Plumbing, Heating & Air Conditioning In Newbern TN</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation requires the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed signed up architect (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you figure out if your structure needs a backflow preventer or multiple gadgets, or if you qualify for an exemption. Exemptions, which are granted in very uncommon cases where the structure is considered to not posture a threat to the supply of water, must be filed with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the homeowner. If your building has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you must have a licensed professional file a record illustration of the device, as well as a preliminary test report of the device for DEP review.</p>
<p>Sometimes a clog can be triggered due to buildup and grease within the system. If this holds true, snaking the drain will not fix the problem.
