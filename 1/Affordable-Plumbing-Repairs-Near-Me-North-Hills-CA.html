<p>While battling a fire, firefighters are naturally more worried about drawing adequate water to splash the blaze than backflow prevention.

<p>You reside in an older house. There's a good chance that you'll need to have it done soon if your house is 50 years old or older and you've never ever replaced its pipes. Galvanized pipes were frequently installed in houses of this age, and these types of pipes are known to burst and rust when they get old. If so, you may need to add a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you do not already have one. This normally includes anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the general cost of the garbage disposal installation.</p>
<p>Backflow preventers not conforming to these rules for an offered application and which are worn out or broken and require replacement needs to be changed by a backflow preventer which does comply to the guidelines for the given application.
