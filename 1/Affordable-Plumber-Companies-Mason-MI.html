Instead of needing to put the waste into the garbage, where it might potentially end up in a landfill, garbage disposals let you grind the waste up into small particles that can be flushed to the septic system or sewer.</p>
<p>A waste disposal unit should not leak. When this takes place, it typically shows wear and tear which is a fair indication that its time is up. If you think of what you put down the disposal, leaks can be unclean and will also eventually trigger pressure on other parts of your waste disposal unit. The kitchen sink drain might need a simple tightening up or a replacement. You will see the obvious spray if the leak is in the pressurized hose spray. For a leak in the drain pipe, you may have to fill the sink with water before examining the pipe underneath.</p>
