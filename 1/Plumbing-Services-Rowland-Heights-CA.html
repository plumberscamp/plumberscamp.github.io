<p>Water softening uses a process called "ion exchange" to get rid of dissolved difficult water minerals such as calcium, manganese, iron and magnesium. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular reaction is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto salt, and as the hard water flows through the resin, the salt is swapped for the difficult water minerals. The hard water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace amount of salt flows out with the softened water.</p>

Hanging on a pipeline might cause it to come loose or break, launching gas into the house. The outdoor gas meter ought to be kept clear of any particles, such as plants or snow, so it is easily accessible in an emergency.</p>
