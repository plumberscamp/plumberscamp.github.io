<p>The next criteria to assess is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is very important that the repair service technician understands the correct installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to make sure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly should be set up in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. Most backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, however it is necessary that the assembly only be set up if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work appropriately and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work since the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>

You 'd be hard-pressed to discover a homeowner grumble about the truth that they have a waste disposal unit, and many don't understand what to do if they move into a house that does not have one.
