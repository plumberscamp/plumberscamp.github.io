<h3>Plumbing, Heating & Air Conditioning In Atlantic City NJ</h3>
<p>These men were amazing! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem off and on for years now. It was set up 7 years ago, and it never drained this well. I picked this company since they had great reviews and a fair price, and despite the fact that the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a substantial, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did an excellent job cleaning up after it too.</p>
