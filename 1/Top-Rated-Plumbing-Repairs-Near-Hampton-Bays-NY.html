<p>Because it can spread out contaminated water back through a distribution system, Backflow is a potential problem in a water system. For example, backflow at unrestrained cross connections (cross-connections are any potential or actual connection between the public supply of water and a source of contamination or pollution) can permit pollutants or impurities to go into the safe and clean water supply. Illness can arise from consuming water that has been polluted due to backflow.</p>
<p>The best source for this type of plumber is a general contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work before it's concealed; you do not get that opportunity. In addition, your contractor knows the dead giveaways of quality work that you might miss out on, like clean solder joints, crisp 90-degree angles at joints and clean, correctly sized holes in studs, floorings, and joists. Finally, a quality contractor will not risk working with an inferior plumber. A basic mistake-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can quickly ravage $10,000 worth of walls or wood floors and complicate the task with insurance coverage claims, wasted time, and suits. With so much riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick to only the very best.</p>
