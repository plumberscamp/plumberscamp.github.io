Lastly, a quality contractor will not danger working with a shoddy plumber. An easy mistake-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can quickly devastate $10,000 worth of walls or hardwood floorings and complicate the task with insurance claims, lost time, and claims.

When something blocks the pipes, anything you pour down there won't go through.</p>
