<p>Once the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and inspected and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some parts may have very tight tolerances that need to be maintained. A crucial thing to identify on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the element. The guide is an extremely important part of the style of each part. If the part is not fixed effectively, the guide could limit the movement (instead of steady or direct) of the component, which might trigger the element to not work to its abilities.

Most of the times the guides are limiting the travel of the component triggering lower test results than what is needed.</p>
