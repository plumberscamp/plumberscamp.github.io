<p>In the meantime, however, we recommend you first try utilizing non-harsh and non-abrasive white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Just pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, include some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. If that does not work, you can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. Many of these cleaners include focused levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be extremely damaging if it can be found in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. If using one of these items, please make sure to take the appropriate precautions.</p>
