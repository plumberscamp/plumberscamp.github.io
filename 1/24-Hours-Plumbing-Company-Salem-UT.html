<p>Trenchless Sewer Replacement Professionals: If you have actually had a sewer or drain back-up, chances are it's not the first and will not be the last. Multiple back-ups normally suggest your sewage system is failing. We suggest following up with a complete video inspection of the entire system to determine what is triggering the issue and to identify whether it will be a repeating issue. Whether it's wear and tear due to age or roots discovering their method to water, we'll be able to see the issue and present you with your alternatives.

<p>Installing a brand-new gas line in the kitchen will typically range from $300 to $800 depending upon the length of the pipe required. If you're converting your home to natural gas, or if the existing line is at capacity, expect to spend $2,000 or more. New gas line expenses include device connections, shut-off valves, a gas meter, and connection of the gas to the main gas line in the street.</p>
