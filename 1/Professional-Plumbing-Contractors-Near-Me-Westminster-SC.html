<p>Button Plumbing was great. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the past. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was rather reasonable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely happy with their service.</p>
