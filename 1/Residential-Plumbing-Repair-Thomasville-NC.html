<p>Backflow is the unwanted reversal of flow in a safe and clean water circulation system. Water that is always under pressure can just flow in one instructions. Then how can water circulation in reverse? Water will always flow toward the point of lowest pressure.

<p>Remodeling plumbers usually charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Again, this doesn't include the cost of parts. However more and more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their quotes are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly invest much more. With this method, you know the turnkey price entering into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>

If your toilet obstructs more than once weekly, it's time for a brand-new one.</p>
