<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of one or more affected areas of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost reliable, it is possible to just abandon the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future.
