<h3>Plumbing, Drains & Water Cleanup West Hollywood CA</h3>
<p>Using dissimilar metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic deterioration Direct contact in between dissimilar metals will initiate the formation of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever two various types of metal are conductively connected to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is developed because of the process. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight linked to copper pipe. It is also worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to reduce this direct contact between the different metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating product that physically separates contact in between the two metals.</p>
