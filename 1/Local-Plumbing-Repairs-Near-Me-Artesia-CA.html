Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when unfavorable or decreased pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity.
