<p>When pressure in a water system goes beyond the pressure in the drinkable system offering the make-up water, backpressure is produced. This can require the drinkable water to reverse its direction of flow through the cross-connection in between the two systems. Possible contaminants can then get in the safe and clean water system.

When these parts wear, they lead to small leaks that are tough to see with the naked eye. This is why it is necessary to call a plumber as quickly as you suspect you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not just does a leaking toilet drainage, it can likewise lead to flooding and water damage.</p>
