<p>When to repair: Toilet clogs are not unusual, but if your toilet is obstructing more than three times a month, there's a larger problem to take a look at.

<p>In some families, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to method when looking for a feasible option, specifically when easy plunging doesn't seem to work. However, there are many downsides to utilizing these dangerous items - not least of which is that they typically consist of compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing a blockage, which can vary from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small things, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, but at the cost of presenting the risk of damage to your house and household.</p>
