<p>Another typical argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves should prevent backflow.  The apparent issue with this is that if the backflow takes place at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic manually run valve should stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if fully closed, has excellent seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless most of the automated valves, such as the electric solenoid valves used for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and totally closed.</p>
<p>It's a good concept to arrange yearly inspections if your plumbing system is years old and if you understand that you have a history of obstructing or leaking. Test. Contact a third-party Backflow Tester from our Authorized Tester List to test the backflow assembly. The tester will submit the results to us.
