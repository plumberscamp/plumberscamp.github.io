<h3>Tips On Basic Plumbing Emergencies Sharon MA</h3>
<p>The cost to replace galvanized pipes is from $2,000 to $15,000 depending upon if you use PEX, copper, or another product.

<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. They changed my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was quite affordable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely pleased with their service.</p>
