<p>Determining if you need a water softener is a personal choice. Water softener systems work by removing firmness minerals and changing them with salt ions.

Due to the fact that water conditioners use a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are in some cases considered a greener option in areas where it is forbidden to utilize salt. Water conditioners do not effectively remove firmness from the water supply, nevertheless, as the only way to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
