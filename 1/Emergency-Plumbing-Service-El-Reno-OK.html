<p>Echologics has a long history of developing award-winning acoustic innovations for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a camera through the household sewer pipes (generally from your house to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be utilized to examine the type and condition of underground pipes, and to determine problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, clogs, corrosion or collapsed pipes. Homeowners may have a video inspection done to discover the cause of regular sewer backups or other ongoing problems, or when offering or purchasing an older home.</p>

<p>Plumbers repair and install water, gas, and other piping systems in companies, homes, and factories.

Plumbers likewise help maintain septic tanks-- big, underground holding tanks that gather waste from houses that are not linked to a sewer system.</p>
<p>Your house's drainage works by the basic force of gravity. When you flush water and lose down your sink or shower (and your toilets also) it's not truly the circulation of water pressing them down your pipes. Rather, once they go down your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. Anything you put down there won't go through when something obstructs the pipes.</p>
