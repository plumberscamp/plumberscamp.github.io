<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Fed Up With False Promises? Water flows in the tank where small resin beads switch the calcium and magnesium in the water for the sodium or potassium they're holding. The beads function as a sponge, adsorbing the solidity minerals from your water. This process is referred to as ion exchange, and soft water is the outcome. When the resin beads have maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a procedure called regeneration). During this process, the resin beads are cleaned with the highly concentrated saltwater solution (brine) from the tank (made from the salt you contributed to the tank). The brine requires the calcium and magnesium ions to be released from the beads and replaced with salt or potassium ions.</p>

<p>If you notice low water pressure or stained water, it generally symbolizes rust and mineral buildup. As rust and minerals build up gradually, they restrict the flow of the water which is why you may observe lower water pressure. The staining takes place when rust ends up being loose from the pipes and circulation into your water supply, affecting the water quality. Having plumbing pipes that have rust or deterioration can become a health threat in your water.</p>
<p>In some households, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to approach when searching for a viable solution, particularly when simple plunging doesn't seem to work. Nevertheless, there are many disadvantages to using these hazardous items - not least of which is that they typically include substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing a clog, which can vary from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little things, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of presenting the danger of harm to your home and household.</p>
