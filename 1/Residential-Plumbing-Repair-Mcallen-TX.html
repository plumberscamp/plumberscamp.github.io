Enzyme-Based Drain Cleaners: Like the baking soda and vinegar mixture, an enzyme treatment will also keep pipes running efficiently.

<p>Current advances in toilet technology have actually made contemporary bathrooms even more functional and comfy. If your toilet was made before 1994, then it's most likely costing you cash every day. New toilets use almost two gallons less per flush while using the very same or much better flushing power as their outdated equivalents. Jeff Gorton, an editor at The Family Handyman, will reveal you how to get rid of and remove of a hot water heater in our video tutorial.
