<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the homes in our area were developed before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water became standard. Older houses were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that can be found in contact with water and oxygen will rust. This corrosion, or rust, triggers the iron to swell up and become flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and develops a waterproof membrane to secure the iron from rusting.</p>
<p>Include more hot water if it gradually drains away as you work. Keep plunging until the drain is clear or you decide it's time to try a new approach. Tankless systems link straight to your plumbing and just heat the water as it is required. This leads to savings on your energy bill.
