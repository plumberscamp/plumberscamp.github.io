<p>When pressure in a water system surpasses the pressure in the safe and clean system supplying the make-up water, backpressure is produced. This can require the safe and clean water to reverse its direction of circulation through the cross-connection in between the 2 systems. Potential pollutants can then go into the drinkable water supply. The very best method to minimize build-up is have a professional flush it a minimum of once a year. In some locations of Virginia, where the water is particularly tough with high mineral material, you might need to flush the water heater more often.</p>

<p>Button Plumbing was great. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the previous. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was rather affordable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was very happy with their service.</p>
