<p>Never worry about hidden charges or surprise charges with Plumb Perfect Plumbing! We provide affordable flat-rate costs on all our services. The home still had lead pipes. Homes built in the very first part of the 1900s were plumbed using lead pipes. At that time, individuals had no idea that the lead in the pipes might seep into the drinking water, let alone the health threats connected with lead.</p>
<p>Renovation plumbers normally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Once again, this does not consist of the cost of parts. However a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their bids are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily spend far more. With this method, you know the turnkey cost entering into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's duty, not yours.</p>
