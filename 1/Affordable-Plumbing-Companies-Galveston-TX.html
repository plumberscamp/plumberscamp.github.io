<p>Loose flanges are usually the result of wood rot. The flange screws merely will not keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best solution depends on the extent of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into company wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this type of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
