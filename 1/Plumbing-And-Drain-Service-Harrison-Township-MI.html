<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the houses in our area were constructed prior to 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water became standard. Older homes were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that is available in contact with water and oxygen will corrode.

The zinc bonds with the iron and develops a waterproof membrane to safeguard the iron from rusting.</p>

<h3>Plumbers And House Plumbing Harrison Township MI</h3>
