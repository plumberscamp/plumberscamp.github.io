<p>In this scenario, unclean water from the hillside swimming pool will back- siphon or back-flow down the hosepipe and into the clean water tank. You also need to invest in a backflow valve if you see your water has an uncommon circulation, odor, taste or color. A plumbing professional can figure out whether the problem with your faucet is a quick fix or the outcome of other concerns in your house's plumbing system. More complicated issues with water temperature or pressure may require changing the hot water heater, which typically costs $350-$ 3,500, depending on capability and type.</p>
<p>Call a skilled and credible plumber for your plumbing problems. Do-it-yourself plumbing is not always the best path, specifically for more complex plumbing problems.
