Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water system pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on.
