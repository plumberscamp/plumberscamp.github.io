<p>The Phoenix Uniform Plumbing Code secures the public water supply and private on-site water system and distribution systems by restricting cross-connections in between drinkable (suitable for drinking) and non-potable water systems, and by needing installation of secondary and primary backflow prevention techniques. Secondary backflow methods provide an increased level of security for the general public supply of water system.</p>
<p>Tank to Tank installation: On average, replacing a gas or electrical water tank with a similar design takes 2 to 3 hours. It takes between 45 to 60 minutes to drain, detach and eliminate your old water heater. Placing the new system takes roughly thirty minutes, and it takes another 45 to 60 minutes to secure the brand-new connection points and confirm that all functions depend on code.</p>

When something blocks the pipes, anything you put down there won't go through.</p>
