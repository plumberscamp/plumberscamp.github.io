Water conditioners do not effectively get rid of hardness from the water supply, nevertheless, as the only method to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
<p>The individual who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not needed to obtain this accreditation.
