<p>A. Typically wax doesn't "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undetected issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
<p>If you observe low water pressure or blemished water, it typically signifies rust and mineral buildup. As rust and minerals build up gradually, they restrict the flow of the water which is why you may notice lower water pressure. The staining occurs when rust becomes loose from the pipes and flow into your water system, affecting the water quality. Having plumbing pipes that have rust or corrosion can end up being a health hazard in your water.</p>
