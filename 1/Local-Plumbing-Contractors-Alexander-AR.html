<h3>Local Plumbers & Contractors Alexander AR</h3>
<p>In water circulation systems, water is normally preserved at a substantial pressure to enable water to flow from the tap, shower, or other fixture. Water pressure may be or stop working minimized when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is unexpectedly high demand on the water supply (for example, when numerous fire hydrants are opened). Minimized pressure in the pipe may allow polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
<p>You hear water dripping or running in the tank. When water runs backward through your pipes and into the drinking water system, a backflow takes place. The water flowing in reverse from a cross-connection might infect the drinking supply of water. Lawn watering systems, pool, and hot tubs are common cross-connection points.
