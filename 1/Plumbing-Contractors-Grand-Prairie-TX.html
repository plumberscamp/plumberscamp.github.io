<p>The next requirements to examine is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is important that the repair professional understands the correct installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to guarantee there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly need to be set up in the installation orientation for which it was approved. The majority of backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, however it is important that the assembly just be installed if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work effectively and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work because the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>

<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the past. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was rather affordable. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly happy with their service.</p>
