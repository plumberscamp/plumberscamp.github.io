You 'd be hard-pressed to find a homeowner grumble about the truth that they have a garbage disposal, and many don't understand what to do if they move into a home that does not have one. Garbage disposals lower household refuse by grinding it up and sending it into the sewer system. They are convenient and end up being an overlooked product of benefit in the home. Nevertheless, they can end up being headaches if they are set up improperly.</p>
<p>Renovation plumbers normally charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Again, this does not consist of the cost of parts. However more and more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly invest much more. With this method, you know the turnkey rate entering into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's obligation, not yours.</p>
