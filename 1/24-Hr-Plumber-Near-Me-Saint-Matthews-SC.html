<p>A continuously running toilet suggests your home is squandering water and you're paying greater utility expenses than needed.

It will be much less expensive to hire the right team now instead of ignoring the issue and enabling comprehensive damage to your plumbing system.</p>
<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a used flapper is generally the offender. But not constantly. First, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper.

A master plumber need to pass an exam that normally encompasses both composed and practical knowledge. They must likewise complete continuing education hours every year.
