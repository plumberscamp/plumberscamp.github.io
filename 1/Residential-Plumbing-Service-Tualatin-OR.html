It's important to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much higher pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Changes in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will trigger a properly working RPZ assembly to regularly release small amounts of water. During a backflow condition, a big volume of water will stream from the relief valve. For this factor, RPZ assemblies shouldn't be set up in locations subject to water damage. Appropriate drainage must also be provided.</p>

<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in potable water supply pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
