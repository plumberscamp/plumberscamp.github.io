<p>Aside from these 2 important components, there are a myriad of little, maybe less vital things that can break or weaken. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away a lot more quickly. Constant gross smells originating from the toilet can indicate you need a new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. You might need a brand-new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting appropriately. Bulges in the supply line can burst and trigger a leak. If mishandled, tank covers can break and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed. While this will not impact the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom.

Make sure it's changed correctly (Image 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You do not have to empty the tank to make these changes.</p>
