<p>Your kitchen sink is an integral part of your home, which makes its plumbing's effective functioning a requirement more than a need. Once the test results reveal the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated during the repair process. It is necessary that the plumbing system be switched on very gradually to assure no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air needs to be eliminated from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system should be examined to make sure no valves were unintentionally exposed or did not close properly when re-pressurized. When the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are completely open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has been gone back to service.</p>

<p>Light Blue = Reduced Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is decreased by the # 1 Check spring (for example, to 90 psi). This pressure difference throughout the # 1 check valve preserves the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone rises towards the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, avoiding backflow (reverse motion of fluid).</p>
