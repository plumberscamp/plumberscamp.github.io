This is most likely due to the fact that there are anywhere from 300 to 350 million toilets in the U.S. alone. Due to the vast number of toilets, we have actually repaired many toilets in homes throughout the Tampa area so we are very familiar with the items utilized and how they are installed here in your area. We also have done lots of toilet replacements too; this is generally required when either a resident chooses to replace their toilet with perhaps a more effective one or when a toilet is merely beyond repair.</p>
