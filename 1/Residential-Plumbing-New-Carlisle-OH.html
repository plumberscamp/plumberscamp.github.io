<p>Home water softeners, also called ion exchange units, are appliances that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water.

As soon as the resin beads end up being full of calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium solution gets rid of the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After going through the beads, the resulting chloride option ends up being a waste stream that decreases the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>

The factors for this can range from leaks, malfunctioning or faulty electrical wiring, or a broken heating aspect or thermostat. If it is one of the mentioned issues, a repair or replacement of the components may be enough. However, if the hot water heater system has all of these problems happening regularly, then a water heater replacement is needed.</p>
