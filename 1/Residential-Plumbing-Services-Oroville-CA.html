<h3>Tankless Hot Water Heater in Oroville California</h2>
<p>Your old discharge tube probably won't be the ideal length for your brand-new disposal. If it's too long, simply connect it to the disposal, mark it and cut it with a hacksaw for your garbage disposal installation. (Loosen the other pipe connections, if required, to place the tube back into the tee.) You may have to make a time-wasting trip to the store if the old discharge tube is too brief.
