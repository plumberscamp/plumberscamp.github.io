<p>Determining if you need a water softener is a personal choice. Water softener systems work by removing solidity minerals and replacing them with salt ions. Water conditioners are devices that help avoid the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to inhibit the scale from building up by reducing the effects of the solidity itself. Due to the truth that water conditioners use a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are sometimes considered a greener option in areas where it is forbidden to use salt. Water conditioners do not successfully eliminate firmness from the water supply, however, as the only method to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
