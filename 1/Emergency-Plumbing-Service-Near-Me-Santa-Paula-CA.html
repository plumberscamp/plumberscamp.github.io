By the way, this is a wonderful system. Our energy costs are much lower then previously, the airflow is practically undetectable, the air temp within is even, the humidity contstant, and we have actually had no failures given that installation.</p>
<p>If you hear water running in your toilet and you suspect a leaky toilet tank or toilet bowl, attempt this: spray a few drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and let the toilet sit for about half an hour. After thirty minutes, check to see if any of the water in your toilet bowl has changed color. If it has, you more than likely have a leak.</p>
<p>The source or place of a sewer problem identifies who pays for repair. The City is accountable for the public right of way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another. The property owner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their residential or commercial property line. Easements (normally 10 feet wide) where main drains traverse personal property are an exception to this rule.</p>

From water heater problems to leaking pipes to gas leakages and clogged drains, Premier Service Company, Inc. has you covered.
