<p>Low pH also increases the corrosiveness of water. pH is the measure of hydrogen ion activity in a solution and is used to reveal the strength of the acidity of a service. Solutions with a low pH (< 7) are acids; solutions with a high pH (> 7) are bases. Acids are compounds that launch hydrogen ions, which oxidize the metals in pipes, accelerating deterioration Co2 will potentially contribute to the development of carbonic acid, therefore making the water more destructive. The existence of high levels of co2 tends to associate with specific geologic conditions.</p>
