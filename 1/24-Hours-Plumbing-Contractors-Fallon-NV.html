<h3>Working Consistently With Your Emergency Plumber Fallon NV</h3>
<p>These guys were incredible! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem off and on for several years now. It was set up 7 years ago, and it never drained this well. I picked this company since they had excellent evaluations and a reasonable price, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a big, disgusting mess on their hands (actually), and they did an excellent job cleaning up after it as well.</p>
