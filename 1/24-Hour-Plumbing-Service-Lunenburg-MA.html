<p>The pipe-bursting method is utilized on pipes that are seriously damaged, for changing a whole pipe system, or for repairing bigger sections of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to start repair, which includes two 4 foot square gain access to pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers start by placing a "bursting head" at the gain access to point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is utilized to drag the head through the pipe.

The pipe is a plastic product that will be impervious to root intrusion for as much as 100 years.</p>

Repiping is mostly done on old pipes that were built in the '70s and constructed out of galvanized metals.</p>
