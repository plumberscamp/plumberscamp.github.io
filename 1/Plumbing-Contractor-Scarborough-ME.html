<p>Once the elements are placed back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is all set to be pressurized. It is very important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the downside shut down remains in the closed position. This permits the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in an accurate movement. As soon as the assembly is pressurized, then any accumulated air needs to be eliminated from the body. The majority of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from crucial locations in the assembly. In some models, test cocks can be utilized to eliminate air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in an area where the air will collect.</p>
