A standard manually operated valve should stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if totally closed, has excellent seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless the majority of the automatic valves, such as the electric solenoid valves utilized for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and totally closed.</p>
