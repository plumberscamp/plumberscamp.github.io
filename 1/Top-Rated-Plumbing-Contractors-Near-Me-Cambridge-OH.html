<h3>Difference Between Plumbers And Plumbing Contractors Cambridge OH</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water system pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in potable water supply pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
