<p>Your kitchen sink is an integral part of your home, which makes its plumbing's efficient functioning a requirement more than a need. Once the test results reveal the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated during the repair procedure.

Each outlet on the plumbing system ought to be examined to ensure no valves were unintentionally left open or did not close appropriately when re-pressurized. When the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are completely open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has actually been gone back to service.</p>
