<p>The City of Bellingham needs a backflow preventer on any cross-connection or possible cross-connection. The backflow preventer may be needed on the water service line, within the structure, or in both areas.

Assemblies not currently listed must have been noted at the time of the initial installation.</p>
<p>Most softeners have a bypass developed into the outlet and the inlet. By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in the event you need to supply some kind of maintenance to it or even while you're working on installing it. If the softener you pick does not have a bypass, then it's smart to develop one out of plumbing to bypass the equipment in case you need to maintain the system.</p>
