At this moment, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regrowth. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt service. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to utilize as soon as backwashing is complete. Some water softeners will instantly change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch.
