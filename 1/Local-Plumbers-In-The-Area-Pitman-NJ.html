The pipe lining process involves our team saturating a felt liner with a special resin mix. It is pushed through your pipeline when the felt liner is totally saturated. As the liner moves through your pipes, it coats the interior walls, sealing all cracks and flaws. The liner is left to solidify in location for a number of hours or 60 minutes if heat is utilized. Once the process is total, the liner will be removed and your pipe will be checked one more time to make certain your brand-new pipe is set within your existing one.</p>

The repair may be as simple as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates data on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to know what the field test data implies for that particular assembly.  When an experienced tester translates the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
