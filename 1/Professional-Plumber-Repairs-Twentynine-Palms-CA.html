Points at which a drinkable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they must be thoroughly created and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
