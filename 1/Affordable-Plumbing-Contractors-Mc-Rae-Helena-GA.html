<p>Lots of home owners install gas lines for gas ranges, heating systems, fireplaces or other gas operable devices in the house. Gas lines deliver the natural energy source to the home securely. Gas lines need to meet certain requirements to guarantee that there are no gas leakages that might be damaging to the occupants. The service technician should ensure that the pipes are designed to correctly deliver gas to the home.</p>
<p>Remodeling plumbers usually charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Once again, this does not consist of the cost of parts. But more and more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their bids are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly invest far more. With this method, you understand the turnkey cost going into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's duty, not yours.</p>
