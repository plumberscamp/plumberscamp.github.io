<h3>Working Consistently With Your Emergency Plumber New Castle IN</h3>
<p>These men were fantastic! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem off and on for many years now. It was set up 7 years ago, and it never drained this well. I selected this company because they had terrific reviews and a fair rate, and despite the fact that the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a huge, revolting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a terrific task tidying up after it as well.</p>
<p>Depending on the level of the clog, we might utilize a range of various approaches, the most typical being hydro-jetting.

Lay the garbage disposal on its side and eliminate the electrical cover plate from the bottom. Loosen the green ground screw and remove wire adapters. Detach waste disposal unit wires from electrical supply wires. Loosen screws on the electrical clamp adapter and get rid of wires from the garbage disposal.</p>
