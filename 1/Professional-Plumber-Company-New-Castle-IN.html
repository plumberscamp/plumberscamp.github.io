It was set up 7 years ago, and it never drained this well. I selected this company because they had terrific reviews and a fair rate, and despite the fact that the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a huge, revolting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a terrific task tidying up after it as well.</p>

Detach waste disposal unit wires from electrical supply wires. Loosen screws on the electrical clamp adapter and get rid of wires from the garbage disposal.</p>
