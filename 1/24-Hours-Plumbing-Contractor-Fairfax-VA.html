<p>3. Solar Salt comes from vaporized seawater and may in some cases leave a pink "bio-film" or stain in sinks and tubs. The pink movie is really a safe bacteria that comes from the sea salt. The Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) suggests switching to one of the other two types of salts if this stain is an annoyance in your home. As soon as the new salt has had a possibility to totally replace the solar salt in your system, then buy some water softener filter cleaner to clean out your softener as advised in your owner's handbook or on the cleaner label.</p>
<p>Drain obstructions in bathroom sinks can occur in time from the accumulation of hair, little bits of soap and fibers from towels that collects inside of pipes.
