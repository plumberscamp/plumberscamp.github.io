<p>Whether a water supply is identified "soft" or "tough" is dependent on the presence of two highly soluble minerals, calcium and magnesium. From a health perspective, these minerals have no negative results and are, in fact, vital day-to-day nutrients. It is minerals that offer water the revitalizing flavor many individuals find desirable. However, when calcium and magnesium penetrate water, they buildup on contact surface areas, possibly plug pipes and damage hot water heater, and reduce the efficiency of cleaning agents and soaps. At this point the water is said to be difficult.</p>
<p>Wet pipe systems are installed in areas where the ambient temperature level is maintained at or above 40 Â° F. When a sprinkler is activated by heat from a fire, water streams instantly from the sprinkler head. These systems have water in the pipe at all times. In scenarios where there is a need to supply sprinklers in an unheated area, such as a small packing dock, an antifreeze system can be utilized. The addition of this chemical additive will require the installation of a high danger protection assembly.</p>
