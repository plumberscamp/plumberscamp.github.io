<p>Organic particles, such as hair, food, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the cause of clogged drains. The most typical method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's drain, snake or cable television auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, however this isn't a newbie's Do It Yourself task. If you use the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it deserves it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
<p>So now that you understand you have a backup in your main line, how do you clear it? Regrettably, main line blockages are not something a homeowner can fix. This kind of clog requires a professional plumber or drain professional to utilize a drain cleaning machine to locate the clog and get it cleared. TLC can use a camera to see down into the drain line and locate the clog or break in the line. All TLC's Drain Cleaning Professionals are equipped with this type of camera to identify and repair the drain problem. This type of camera is especially beneficial in finding an issue if you have a long sewer line from your house to the sewer system or septic system.</p>

<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumber North Reading MA</h3>
<p>If pressure is lost, a backflow preventer stops water inside your water pipes from flowing back to the City system. Backflow can pollute the water supply. The standard mechanism for preventing backflow is a mechanical backflow prevention device, which provides a physical barrier to backflow. All leakages, worn out fittings, and other plumbing problems will be resolved.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the previous. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was rather affordable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely delighted with their service.</p>
