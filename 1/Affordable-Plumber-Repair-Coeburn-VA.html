<p>When you remove the cap to eliminate the valve, check the washer for wear or cracks. Replacing a bad washer is simple and inexpensive. However finding the right washer may not be. The most typical washers are often offered in your home centers and hardware stores. Other styles can be hard to discover. Remove it and take it to the shop to discover a match if you choose to hunt for a washer. Plumbers usually replace the entire fill valve instead of hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
