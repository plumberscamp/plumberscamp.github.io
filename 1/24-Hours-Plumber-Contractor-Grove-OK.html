<p>A rule of thumb is that you can recapture the cost of the repair if the problems takes place well outside that 8 to 12 year lifespan.

The closer the device is to that 8 to 12-year limitation, the more skeptical the economics of a repair becomes. The factor is that some other part on the appliance will go or its tank will leak. And there's no cure for a leaking tank.</p>
