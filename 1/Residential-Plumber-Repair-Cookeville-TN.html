TLC's drain specialists are qualified and experienced in performing drain and sewer line inspections for residential properties. We offer video inspections so purchasers and sellers can get a thorough analysis of the drain system.</p>
<p>It's hard to figure out if you have split or broken drains until a video inspection is carried out. Split or broken drains are generally preceded by recurring obstructions, constant foul drain smells or the existence of sewer flies. The initial step is attempt to clear the blocked drain and after that instantly check the drain. In many cases a smoke test can be carried out to reveal breaks or cracks. ZOOM DRAIN carries out a free peek video inspection with our PowerSnake and ZOOM Jetting service.</p>
