Water conditioners are gadgets that help prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They utilize a physical media to prevent the scale from developing by neutralizing the firmness itself. Due to the truth that water conditioners use a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are sometimes thought about a greener alternative in areas where it is forbidden to utilize salt. Water conditioners do not effectively remove firmness from the water supply, nevertheless, as the only way to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
