<p>In some cases, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces data on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to know what the field test data implies for that specific assembly.  When a qualified tester analyzes the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
