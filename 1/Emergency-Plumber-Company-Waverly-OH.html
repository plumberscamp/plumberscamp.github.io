<p>Backflow Preventer: A device that allows water to go through it in one instructions, but prevents it from reversing in the opposite instructions. You have permanent water firmness if you don't see limescale build-up but instead see soap residue, your washing cleaning agents not working as efficiently or your skin getting itchy and delicate. Do not attempt to find the leak if you smell gas. Rather, leave your home or building right now.
