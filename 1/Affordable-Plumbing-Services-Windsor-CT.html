<p>A hot water heater leak can be a symptom of a vast array of problems, all of which should be fixed right away to avoid total appliance failure. While it is possible to fix a water heater leak yourself, it can be a challenging job to identify the source of the water heater leak and repair it securely. Roto-Rooter plumbers are specialists at hot water heater leak repair.</p>
<p>This is a bad indication. Toilets should definitely never ever wobble, move, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. If you can move a toilet around by doing anything less extreme than swinging a sledgehammer at it, that toilet should be changed. Improperly seated and sealed toilets might leak, damage plumbing, or perhaps compromise the structural integrity of the house.</p>
