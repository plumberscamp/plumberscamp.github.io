Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they must be thoroughly designed and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
