<p>The most reliable way to address tough water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the firmness ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When hard water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Breathing in dripped gas in an indoor area, such as your home can lead to an absence of oxygen in the air and cause hypoxia. That can, in turn, lead to extreme headache, fatigue, decreased vision, brief breaths, and even loss of awareness.
