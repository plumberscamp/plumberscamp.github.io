<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Fed Up With False Guarantees? Water circulates in the tank where tiny resin beads swap the calcium and magnesium in the water for the sodium or potassium they're holding. The beads act as a sponge, adsorbing the hardness minerals from your water. This procedure is referred to as ion exchange, and soft water is the result. When the resin beads have actually maxed out their capability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a procedure called regrowth). During this process, the resin beads are washed with the extremely focused saltwater solution (brine) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank). The salt water requires the calcium and magnesium ions to be launched from the beads and replaced with salt or potassium ions.</p>

Look for leaks under the sink to validate that your plumber's putty is making an excellent seal. Get rid of the drain stopper, and enable the drain and P-trap to fill with water.
