<p>Note: Difficult water stops your washing detergent from working effectively because difficult water ions can bond with detergent molecules to deactivate them. You, for that reason, have to utilize more and more detergent to achieve the same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt solution. Tough minerals caught in the resin (or zeolite) are launched and the media gets replenished with sodium ions. The water softener is also cleaned and disinfected during regeneration. Finally, water containing the hard minerals and other waste gets flushed out of the system.</p>
