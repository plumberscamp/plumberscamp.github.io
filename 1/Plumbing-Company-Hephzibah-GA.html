<p>The U-shaped pipe beneath kitchen and bathroom sinks is something that people anticipate to see however rarely stop to think about. Energy Performance. Picking a tank with a minimum of 1.5 inches of foam insulation and an Energy Star ranking is a good idea. The energy performance of a storage hot water heater is indicated by its Energy Element (EF). The more efficient the water heater the higher the EF rating. However, just because a water heater has a greater EF worth, it doesn't constantly imply it will have lower operating costs.

<p>Your old discharge tube probably will not be the best length for your new disposal. If it's too long, just link it to the disposal, mark it and cut it with a hacksaw for your garbage disposal installation.
