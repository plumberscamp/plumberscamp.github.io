<p>The proper repair of a backflow preventer requires lots of products to be evaluated. The hydraulic conditions present at the backflow prevention assembly must be evaluated. The installation must be assessed to guarantee it does not prevent the operations of the assembly. Test information must be collected to determine the functions of each part. The backflow prevention assembly need to be dismantled and parts replaced with original factory parts. The backflow prevention assembly must be checked again to be sure it was effectively fixed. Comparing the test results from the repaired backflow prevention assembly to the producers flow diagram is needed to ensure it was fixed properly. An effectively repaired assembly must supply years of protection.</p>
