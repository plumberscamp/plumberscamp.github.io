<h3>Shower Repairs in Red Wing MN 55066 - The Processes Involved</h3>
<p>When drains are clogged, it is not constantly due to obstructions that come from inside the home. It is possible for drains to become clogged due to tree roots, also known as tree root intrusion. When tree roots begin to make their way inside someone's main sewer line, there is capacity for this to trigger drain problems. The type of drain pipes already installed, such as cast iron, clay, plastic or copper, will determine the level of the damage that tree roots can trigger to a sewer line.</p>
