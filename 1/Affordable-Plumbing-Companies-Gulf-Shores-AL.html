<p>I can't state enough good ideas about this company. Had a sewer repair needed and had a really brief quantity of time due to closing on a house sale. Every individual I encountered from Marquita doing logistics for my task to every member of the work team. Friendly, interacted well, totally responsive and really cared to help me through this extremely stressful job. All of individuals I experienced were role models for what a well run service business need to be. Much thanks and appreciation. You're great.</p>
<p>Remodeling plumbers typically charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts. However increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly spend much more. With this approach, you understand the turnkey cost going into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's duty, not yours.</p>
