Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water system pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, and so on.
