<p>The High Voltage Leak Detection Technology (HVLD) testing process consists of a set of electrode probes which scans a sealed container made from a non-conductive product. Thomas & Galbraith Heating, Cooling & Plumbing supplies repair and replacement services for water heaters in the Cincinnati, Ohio area, as well as cities and towns in the surrounding city. If you notice rusty water, rumbling or banging noises originating from your hot water heater's tank, an increased amount of time required to heat your water, or puddles of water under your water heater, it's time to call the experts about repair or replacement options.</p>
<p>You might be lured to weld or spot a leak shut or replace only a single area of pipe to save cash. While this might work in the short-term, bear in mind that the weakened pipe is made from the very same product as other pipes in your house, suggesting that trouble might be brewing somewhere else in your plumbing system. Repiping now will offer you assurance and prevent larger leaks down the road.</p>
