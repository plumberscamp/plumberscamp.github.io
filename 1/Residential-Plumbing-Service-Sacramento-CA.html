<p>The U-shaped pipe below kitchen and bathroom sinks is something that people expect to see however rarely stop to consider. Energy Efficiency. Choosing a tank with a minimum of 1.5 inches of foam insulation and an Energy Star ranking is a good idea. The energy effectiveness of a storage hot water heater is indicated by its Energy Factor (EF). The more efficient the water heater the greater the EF score. Nevertheless, even if a hot water heater has a higher EF value, it does not constantly suggest it will have lower operating costs. You likewise have to consider the fuel source.</p>
<p>The person who does the testing needs to be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not needed to obtain this certification. I have actually checked with a few plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing varied from $150 - $250, however I would expect the cost to be significantly less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
