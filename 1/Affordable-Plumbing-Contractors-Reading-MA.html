<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer set will be attached to the disposer using the plate, gasket and screws originally intended for the disposer discharge elbow. If your package only consists of a waste arm, it is possible - though not suggested - to link this to the disposer discharge elbow utilizing a slip joint. The successive 90 ° turns in such a setup can cause improper drainage. Depending upon the length of the waste arm, you may be able to cut off its elbow and utilize the remainder as a straight discharge tube.</p>

<p>Your house's drainage works by the basic force of gravity. When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets also) it's not really the flow of water pressing them down your pipes. Instead, once they decrease your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. Anything you pour down there will not go through when something obstructs the pipes.</p>

<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the difficult water is softened. The water supply line feeds the hard water into the tank. The water seeps through the bed of resin beads, depositing the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and streams through your pipes and out to your household devices. Backflow is a term utilized in the plumbing world to explain an undesirable flow of water in the reverse instructions.
