<p>Clearly the resin is not a limitless exchange site. When all the sodium exchange sites are changed with solidity minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regrowth. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. Once backwashing is complete, the softener can be returned to use. Some water softeners will instantly switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 illustrates both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
