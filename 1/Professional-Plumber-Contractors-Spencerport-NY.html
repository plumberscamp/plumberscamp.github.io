<p>Backflow suggests the undesirable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable supply of water; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from happening. Points at which a safe and clean water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they should be carefully designed and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
