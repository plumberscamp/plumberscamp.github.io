ZOOM DRAIN carries out a free peek video inspection with our PowerSnake and ZOOM Jetting service.</p>
<p>Gently listen and raise the rod if your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod. You may be able to stop the running by changing the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float change screw on top (see Figure A listed below). If there is no modification screw, bend the float arm. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, make sure it's changed appropriately (Picture 8). You do not have to empty the tank to make these changes.</p>
