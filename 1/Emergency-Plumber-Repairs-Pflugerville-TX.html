<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>The function of the Plumbing Inspection Program is to guarantee that all plumbing installed during construction of a new or renovated building is set up by experienced artisans in accordance with relevant codes. Wastewater is Flooding Your Sink - A flooding sink is the stock-image for clogged drains. When your sink is filling with water after you wash your hands, clean the meals, or put flat soda in your sink, you generally know your drain is clogged and requires cleaning. However, when a clogged drain emerges through flooding, the clog is more than likely in the draining fixture itself. Blockages in a fixture can cause damaging damage to your draining system the longer they persist.</p>
