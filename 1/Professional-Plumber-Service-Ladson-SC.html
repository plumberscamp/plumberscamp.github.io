Water in a gas pipe is almost certainly from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or natural gas is extremely low. Rainwater which has actually not filtered through the earth is an incredibly pure form of water. When water evaporates it leaves behind liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when vaporized water eventually falls as rain - it is soft.</p>

If your house was constructed decades prior to that, opportunities are that your house might need comprehensive repiping so that your house's plumbing can operate at ideal rates.</p>
