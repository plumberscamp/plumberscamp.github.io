<p>Leaks are sly. You have most likely seen drain cleaner products on the shelves at your local home improvement shop, so when your drain gets clogged or isn't draining water like it should, you might be tempted to head down there and choose some as much as fix it on your own.

<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean supply of water pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being utilized surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
