<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and a great man. He told me precisely what to anticipate (cost, time, process) in advance and delivered as promised. I will absolutely use Clog Dawg again. Installing a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with an average per hour rate of $25 to $70. These rates are in addition to the cost of the disposal system. The total you pay might be higher if your plumber has a minimum callout fee that is higher than the labor cost for the work.</p>
<p>Among the things we concentrate on is the bathroom toilet. So many individuals and organisations let the toilet drainage every year with leaking or ineffective designs. This is cash and a natural deposit running down the drain. Water preservation in the desert is essential and older toilets can utilize 3.5 gallons of water per flush! Our master professionals will have the ability to bring back or replace the toilet the exact same day in many cases conserving you time and money.</p>
<p>It helps to know the brand and design of your toilet. The trademark name is typically on the bowl behind the seat. In some cases, the model or number will be on the underside of the lid or inside the tank. Matching an unusual flapper can become a trial-and-error procedure. Even professional plumbers often attempt two or three flappers before they find one that works well.</p>
