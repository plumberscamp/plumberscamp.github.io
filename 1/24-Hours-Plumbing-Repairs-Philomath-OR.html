<p>The individual who does the testing needs to be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not required to obtain this certification.

The choice "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of personal choice not necessity. However, water softening does have advantages, and downsides, that make this choice a considerable one.</p>
