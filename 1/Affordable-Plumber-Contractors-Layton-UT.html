<p>As soon as the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and inspected and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some elements might have really tight tolerances that have to be kept. An essential thing to identify on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the element. The guide is a very important part of the design of each part. If the element is not repaired effectively, the guide could limit the motion (instead of direct or constant) of the part, which might trigger the component to not work to its capabilities. Often times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are restricting the travel of the component triggering lower test results than what is required.</p>
