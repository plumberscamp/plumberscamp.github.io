Another idea to stop obstructing is to keep an eye out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will harden when they cool so it is best to clean pots and pans that have those liquids under warm water and to continue to let the water run for several seconds after you are finished cleaning to make sure the drain is clear.</p>

And if your house was integrated in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are most likely nearing completion of their life expectancy. As galvanized pipes age, they start to rust. This deterioration can lead to a buildup of lead, which can have lots of unfavorable effects on your health. Corroded pipes also result in bad water quality and low water pressure.</p>
