<h3>Difference Between Plumbers And Plumbing Contractors Rutland VT</h3>
<p>These guys were fantastic! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem off and on for several years now. It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I selected this company due to the fact that they had terrific evaluations and a fair rate, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a big, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a fantastic task tidying up after it as well.</p>
