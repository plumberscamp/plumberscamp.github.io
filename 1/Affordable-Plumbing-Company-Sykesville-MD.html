Water pressure might be or fail lowered when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is unexpectedly high demand on the water system (for instance, when numerous fire hydrants are opened). Minimized pressure in the pipe might enable polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
