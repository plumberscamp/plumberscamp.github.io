<p>Aside from these two important components, there are a myriad of small, perhaps less crucial things that can break or deteriorate. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away far more rapidly. Consistent gross smells originating from the toilet can indicate you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. You might need a brand-new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting properly. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. Tank lids can crack and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed if mishandled. While this will not affect the function of your toilet, it definitely doesn't do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by discussing all the things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a complete component and every part needs to be in good shape for it to work at its best.</p>
