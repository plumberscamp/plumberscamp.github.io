<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the houses in our area were developed before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water became standard. Older houses were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that is available in contact with water and oxygen will corrode. This rust, or rust, causes the iron to swell up and become flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and develops a waterproof membrane to protect the iron from rusting.</p>
<p>Rusting and deterioration on the outside of the hot water heater, inlet pipes, or parts can suggest a possible problem with the hot water heater. If it is more than 6 or 7 years old, it can also indicate the water heater is near the end of its life. With heavy rust accumulation on valves for water lines to and from the heater, it could indicate that there have actually been fluctuations in pressure triggering small leaks.</p>
