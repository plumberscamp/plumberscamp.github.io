<p>When utilized in combating a fire, fire department connections can be a concern. Firefighters by and big are not interested in backflow prevention problems. They are concerning with protecting individuals's lives and to a lesser degree their residential or commercial property. Getting the required volume of water on a fire is their objective and they will use water from any source available to achieve that goal. This can create cross-connection control problems and might as a result indicate that the level of security on the fire defense system might need to be increased to a high hazard defense level.</p>
<p>A cross-connection is any permanent or short-term connection between a public water supply or customer's drinkable (i.e., drinking) water system and any source or system including nonpotable water or other compounds. An example is the piping in between a public water supply or customer's drinkable water system and an auxiliary water supply, cooling system or watering system.</p>
