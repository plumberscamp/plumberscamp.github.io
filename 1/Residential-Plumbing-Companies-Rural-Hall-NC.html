<p>The brine tank aids the water softening system in regeneration. It is a much shorter tank that sits adjacent to the mineral tank. The brine tank holds an extremely focused service of salt (or in some cases potassium) to bring back the resin beads' positive charge. Salt is manually added to the brine tank in the form of pellets or blocks. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capacity of the resin is reducing, the heavy brine service is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank.

This might impact the technician's ability to successfully complete the repair if the backflow preventer is installed in a limiting area.</p>
