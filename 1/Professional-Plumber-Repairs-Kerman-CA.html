<h3>Licensed Plumbing & HVAC Company In Kerman CA</h3>
<p>These guys were remarkable! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem off and on for several years now. It was installed 7 years earlier, and it never ever drained this well. I chose this company due to the fact that they had terrific evaluations and a reasonable rate, and despite the fact that the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a big, revolting mess on their hands (actually), and they did an excellent job tidying up after it too.</p>
