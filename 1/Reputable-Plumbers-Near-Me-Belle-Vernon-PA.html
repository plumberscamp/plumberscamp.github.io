How to tell if you have polybutylene pipes: If your pipes are white plastic and include the letters PB" in the printed label, you have polybutylene pipes and we suggest having them changed immediately. Before you can ask for an inspection, you should first acquire the required authorization( s) for the work you intend to do. You can take a look at our Permit page to find out more on getting an authorization. Once you obtain a permit you can start with the work. However, you must call for inspection before you cover or hide any work.</p>
