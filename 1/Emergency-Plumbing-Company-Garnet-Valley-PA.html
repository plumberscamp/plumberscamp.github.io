<p>Your kitchen sink is an essential part of your house, which makes its plumbing's effective functioning a need more than a need. Once the test results show the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated during the repair process. It is important that the plumbing system be turned on very gradually to assure no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air needs to be removed from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system ought to be checked to make sure no valves were mistakenly left open or did not close correctly. When the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are completely open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has actually been returned to service.</p>

<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of one or more affected locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to only desert the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost really rapidly. This is the main reason we will advise a complete repipe in certain neighborhoods, based on our experience.</p>
