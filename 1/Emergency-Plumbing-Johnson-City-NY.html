<p>A. Usually wax does not "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" unnoticed problem. Attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Our professional plumbers offer preventive maintenance, plumbing repairs and emergency maintenance When you request a preventative maintenance service call, you can expect us to completely check your plumbing pipes for indications of leakages, corrosion and malfunctioning or broken water-using devices, like toilets, showers, sinks and water heaters. The issue will be discussed to you and the appropriate repairs will be advised if our plumbers discover any problems with your system.</p>
<p>When the pressure in a private water system goes beyond the pressure in the public water circulation lines that can cause normal flow to reverse, backpressure happens. A pump used to increase the water pressure within a structure's plumbing system to reach a higher floor might trigger this. Preventive cleaning for drains ought to be performed on all drains, including toilet, sink, floor and tub drains.</p>
