<p>When sewer line breaks, it typically causes the yard above it to become soaked.

<p>Your garbage disposal makes sure that your sink and plumbing components don't get clogged. Contrary to some people's understanding, garbage disposals do not consist of blades.

When the disposal is switched on the disks quickly spin, and these bolts force food and particles to grind against a fixed grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action efficiently pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without blocking.</p>
