<p>The salt water tank aids the water softening system in regeneration. It is a much shorter tank that sits adjacent to the mineral tank. The brine tank holds a highly concentrated service of salt (or in some cases potassium) to bring back the resin beads' positive charge. Salt is by hand added to the brine tank in the type of pellets or blocks. These dissolve in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve signs up the softening capacity of the resin is lessening, the heavy salt water option is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. The water passing through the system will no longer be softened if the salt water tank runs out of salt.</p>
<p>Home water softeners, also called ion exchange systems, are home appliances that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. As soon as the resin beads end up being filled with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium service removes the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride option becomes a waste stream that decreases the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
