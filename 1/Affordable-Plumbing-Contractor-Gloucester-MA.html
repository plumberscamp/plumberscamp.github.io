<p>When you get rid of the cap to flush out the valve, check the washer for wear or fractures. Replacing a bad washer is cheap and easy. But discovering the ideal washer may not be. The most typical washers are often available in the house centers and hardware shops. Other styles can be difficult to discover. If you choose to hunt for a washer, eliminate it and take it to the shop to find a match. Plumbers generally replace the whole fill valve rather than hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
