<p>Once the parts are positioned back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is prepared to be pressurized. It is essential to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the disadvantage shut off remains in the closed position. This enables the parts to transfer to their pressurized positions in an accurate motion. As soon as the assembly is pressurized, then any accumulated air needs to be removed from the body. The majority of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from critical areas in the assembly. In some models, test cocks can be used to eliminate air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in an area where the air will accumulate.</p>
<p>A camera inspection takes the guesswork out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it prevents the need to collect your lawn.

Using the images captured by the camera, we can pinpoint any sewer and drain line problems, such as clogs, tree root invasion, misaligned joints, cracks, and other damage.</p>
