A toilet's tank is composed of several small moving parts, such as flapper valves and fill valves, that need to be changed or repaired due to their regular usage. When these parts wear out, they result in small leakages that are tough to see with the naked eye. This is why it is very important to call a plumber as soon as you think you have a leak or a broken tank part.

Even if you make it this far, the only thing you can do if your brand-new tank flush valve doesn't work is look for leakages" and make modifications." All of a sudden, a fifty-minute job turns into a forever unresolved concern.</p>
