<p>5. Put hot water down your drain after using the garbage disposal - In order to get rid of extraneous grease that can clog your kitchen sink, rinse your drain with a bit of hot water.

<p>Remodeling plumbers usually charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Once again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts.

With this technique, you understand the turnkey rate going into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's duty, not yours.</p>
