<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Fed Up With False Guarantees? Water flows in the tank where tiny resin beads switch the calcium and magnesium in the water for the salt or potassium they're holding. The beads serve as a sponge, adsorbing the solidity minerals from your water. This procedure is described as ion exchange, and soft water is the result. When the resin beads have actually maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a procedure called regrowth). Throughout this process, the resin beads are cleaned with the extremely concentrated saltwater service (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank). The brine requires the calcium and magnesium ions to be launched from the beads and replaced with salt or potassium ions.</p>
