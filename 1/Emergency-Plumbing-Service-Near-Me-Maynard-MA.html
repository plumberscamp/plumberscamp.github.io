Due to the reality that water conditioners utilize a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are in some cases thought about a greener alternative in locations where it is prohibited to use salt. Water conditioners do not efficiently eliminate solidity from the water supply, nevertheless, as the only way to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
