First, plans for each device to be set up must be drawn up by a RA or PE, and an application for approval sent out to the DEP, which might take up to 3 weeks or more to process and authorize. Turned down strategies need to be modified and resubmitted to the DEP approval queue, which can add another several weeks to the timeline.</p>
<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we reveal are determined from the inside bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve.

The addition of a backflow preventer decreases water service pressure to the structure; extra, more significant costs can occur if the drop in water pressure ends up being an issue for residents. If installing a pump or bigger size water service and backflow prevention device would neutralize the pressure loss, a PE or RA can help identify.</p>
