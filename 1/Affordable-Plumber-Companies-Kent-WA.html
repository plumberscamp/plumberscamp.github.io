<h3>Why You Need Trustworthy Plumbing Services Kent WA</h3>
<p>These men were incredible! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem on and off for many years now. It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I chose this company because they had excellent evaluations and a fair rate, and even though the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a big, revolting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a fantastic task tidying up after it also.</p>
