<p>Remodeling plumbers generally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Again, this does not include the cost of parts.

Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily spend much more. With this method, you understand the turnkey price entering into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's duty, not yours.</p>
