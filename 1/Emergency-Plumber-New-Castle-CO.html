<p>How to install or replace a garbage disposal. Sewer lines can fail for a range of factors, consisting of bad soil conditions, blockages from grease and grime, and deterioration. Even bushes and trees can cause problems for sewer lines, specifically in older areas where clay pipe might have been used. In the cold Colorado winter seasons, pipes can break from frozen ground, which can be doubly compounded if pipes have actually been enabled to freeze.</p>
<p>Inspect Valves and Dual Checks. There are two other types of backflow preventers readily available that you may encounter. The first is a check valve. The 2nd is a dual check". It is NOT the exact same thing as a Check although it may be marketed as one! Do not get duped! Pressure loss through a check valve tends to be about 3 PSI. Dual Checks have losses similar to Check (5 PSI).</p>
