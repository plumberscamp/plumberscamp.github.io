<p>Water softening uses a process called "ion exchange" to remove dissolved tough water minerals such as calcium, iron, magnesium and manganese. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular response is required. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto sodium, and as the difficult water streams through the resin, the sodium is swapped for the hard water minerals. The tough water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace amount of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>

You'll probably notice lower water pressure in the shower or when washing dishes. The best service is to replace your plumbing with brand-new pipes that don't have accumulation.</p>
