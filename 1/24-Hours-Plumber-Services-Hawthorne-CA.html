<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a few things you can do to keep your drains clear. Prevent putting grease or oil down the drains. Utilize a solution of baking soda and vinegar periodically to keep your drains and waste disposal unit clean. You can use an organic drain cleaner month-to-month to keep your drains clear.
