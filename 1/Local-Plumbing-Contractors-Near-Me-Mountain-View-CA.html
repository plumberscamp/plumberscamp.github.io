<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of one or more afflicted locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost reliable, it is possible to only desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost extremely rapidly. This is the main reason that we will suggest a complete repipe in specific areas, based upon our experience.</p>
