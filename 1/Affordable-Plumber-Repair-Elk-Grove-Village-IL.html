Like any house device, a toilet tank includes many little moving parts that may need replaced with usage with time. Flapper valves, fill valves, and other tank parts can all wear and cause toilet leakages that aren't plainly noticeable to the naked eye. Toilet leaks around the base can also happen around the toilet gaskets (the bolts that seal the tank to the toilet bowl) or the wax ring below the base of the toilet.</p>
<p>Many cars and trucks have a metal line that runs the length of the vehicle with rubber fuel lines linking at either end, one at the fuel tank and the other to the engine.
