<h3>Need A Plumber Service Soquel CA</h3>
<p>The most efficient way to attend to hard water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When difficult water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and changed with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Water treated with a water softener system might not just conserve customers money however might also be eco-friendly, due to the fact that it helps cut back on damaging detergents going into water streams. In locations where there is very difficult water, consumers can frequently cut cleaning agent usage in dishwashers and washing makers by more than 50% after softening and get the same results.</p>
