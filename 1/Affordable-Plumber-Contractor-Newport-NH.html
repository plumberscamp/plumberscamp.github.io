<p>Backflow is bad news. The extreme water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are difficult on pipes. Over a period of time the within lining of the pipe will weaken and a small pinhole leak will develop.

This causes the water to bubble, as only little pockets of air are accessible, resulting in the weird noises originating from your sink.</p>
