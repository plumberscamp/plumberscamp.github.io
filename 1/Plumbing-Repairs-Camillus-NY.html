<p>When sewer line breaks, it often causes the yard above it to end up being soggy.

Plumbers describe a sewer line break as a plumbing emergency. Hopefully, your Evanston plumber's phone number is on your speed dial.</p>

The plumbing in your house should work well or backup can occur, and septic systems may need to be updated to work with the disposal. Baffles: Baffles prevent flatware from entering the waste disposal unit, so you're just sending out food and compostable waste down the drain.</p>
