<p>Depending on your water quality, some softeners may be able to totally or partially eliminate copper, radium, manganese, and iron, in addition to calcium and magnesium. Note that copper can reenter the water after if passes and leaves the softener through your house's pipes and plumbing. These softeners may have unique filter media and might cost more than common softeners. Prior to using a softener for this purpose, follow the suggestions listed in the house Water Treatment.</p>
<p>Your house's drainage works by the easy force of gravity. When you flush water and lose down your sink or shower (and your toilets as well) it's not truly the circulation of water pushing them down your pipes. Rather, once they go down your drain, gravity takes control of as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. When something blocks the pipes, anything you put down there won't go through.</p>

<p>When sewer line breaks, it often triggers the yard above it to end up being soggy. You may smell the horrible odor of sewage before you feel the squish of your lawn under your feet (hopefully shoed feet!).

Plumbers describe a sewer line break as a plumbing emergency. Ideally, your Evanston plumber's telephone number is on your speed dial.</p>

<p>In some cases, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as basic as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates data on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to know what the field test data means for that particular assembly.  When a qualified tester analyzes the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
