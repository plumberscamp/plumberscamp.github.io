<h2>Tips To Hire Residential Plumbing Service in Whitmore Lake</h2>

<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the homes in our area were developed prior to 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water ended up being basic. Older houses were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that is available in contact with water and oxygen will rust. This deterioration, or rust, causes the iron to swell up and become flaky. In order to prevent the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and produces a waterproof membrane to secure the iron from rusting.</p>
<p>Is your home 50+ years old? Up through the mid-twentieth century, galvanized steel was the primary product used in plumbing. While galvanized steel is strong, it normally catches deterioration after about 50 years and requires replacement.
