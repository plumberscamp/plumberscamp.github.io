<p>When you get rid of the cap to eliminate the valve, examine the washer for wear or fractures. Changing a bad washer is cheap and easy. But discovering the best washer may not be. The most typical washers are typically offered in your home centers and hardware stores. Other styles can be difficult to discover. Remove it and take it to the store to find a match if you choose to hunt for a washer. Plumbers normally replace the whole fill valve instead of hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
