If it's too long, just connect it to the disposal, mark it and suffice with a hacksaw for your waste disposal unit installation. (Loosen the other pipe connections, if essential, to place the tube back into the tee.) You may have to make a time-wasting journey to the store if the old discharge tube is too brief. To avoid this, make sure the new waste disposal unit installation set includes a tube, or buy one independently at the very same time for about $3.</p>
