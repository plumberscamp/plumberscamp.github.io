<p>As a locally-owned organisation, integrity and duty are exceptionally essential to developing a credibility for quality. Section 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of seclusion backflow preventers (BFP) and Section 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses defense of the potable supply of water within a structure these devices are known as seclusion" BFP. Once again, the best kind of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would stream over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to ensure there is an air gap, if there is no other way to offer one, then we check to see that the proper BFP device is set up. These BFP's, if testable, are needed to be evaluated (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and a minimum of every twelve months afterwards.</p>
<p>Backflow prevention assemblies are designed to supply years of defense. There are lots of local conditions that can shorten the working life of a backflow preventer.  Conditions such as excessive pressure, water quality, turbidity or temperature can all trigger the assembly to weaken in its performance. Some backflow prevention assemblies may hardly ever need repair while some are fixed regularly. The test information from the field test will identify the repair frequency.</p>
