Points at which a drinkable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they should be carefully designed and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
