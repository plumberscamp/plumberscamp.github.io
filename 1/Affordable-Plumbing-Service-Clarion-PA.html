Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they should be carefully designed and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
