The repair might be as simple as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces information on the workings of the assembly.

When a skilled tester analyzes the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
