Water in a gas pipe is likely from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water material of LP or gas is extremely low. Rainwater which has actually not filtered through the earth is an incredibly pure type of water. When water vaporizes it leaves dissolved solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. Therefore when vaporized water eventually falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
<p>Drain clogs in bathroom sinks can take place over time from the accumulation of hair, little bits of soap and fibers from towels that accumulates within pipes. As a clog ends up being larger with time, it obstructs the pipe, stopping water from draining pipes properly. You can combat tough water in various ways, consisting of filtering it by distillation or reverse osmosis, adding a packaged chemical softener such as powdered borax or washing soda (sodium carbonate), or running it through a water softener.</p>
