<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in safe and clean water system pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
