<h3>What To Do About Burst Pipes In The Middle Of The Night Sartell MN</h3>

A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe. It is likewise worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to reduce this direct contact in between the dissimilar metals.
