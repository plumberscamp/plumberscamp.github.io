<p>Gently listen and lift the rod if your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod. If the water turns off, you may be able to stop the running by changing the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float change screw on top (see Figure A listed below). If there is no modification screw, bend the float arm.
