Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When tough water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and changed with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>

This might be an indication that the mechanism that flushes requirements changed, the water jets are simply not working to flush the excrement down, or your water pressure is too low. No matter the cause, Vegas Valley Plumbing need to be contacted to have a look at your toilet.</p>
