Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on.
