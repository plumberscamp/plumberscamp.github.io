Hard water interferes with the lathering of soaps and shampoos, triggering you to utilize more. Tough water also makes it more difficult to wash soap off your body, or hair shampoo out of your hair, which can lead to dandruff and itchiness of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely find that difficult water triggers your skin to flake, itch, and redden frequently.</p>
