<p>You reside in an older house. If your house is 50 years old or older and you've never changed its pipes, there's a likelihood that you'll need to have it done soon. Galvanized pipes were most often installed in homes of this age, and these types of pipes are understood to burst and rust when they get old. You may need to include a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you don't currently have one if so. This usually includes anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the general cost of the waste disposal unit installation.</p>
<p>Converting your home to gas, or if the current line is at capability, you'll need to install a brand-new gas line from the street to your home. This remains in addition to any interior gas lines or extensions that need to be installed.
