<p>Galvanized metal, is just a simpler way of stating zinc covered" and what causes galvanized pipes to wear away is the exposure to excessive water and minerals. You might be thinking that it doesn't make good sense to use a pipe that reacts with water as your house's main source of water transport, and you would be correct. However, when the majority of these pipes were being set up, no one understood this was going to be the outcome. Thankfully, there are a lot of other piping options nowadays consisting of copper.</p>
<p>Deluge systems are created so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems generally are set up in locations where the possibility of a serious fire condition is likely, such as airplane garages. Water to the system is kept back by the deluge valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire happens, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then allows water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
