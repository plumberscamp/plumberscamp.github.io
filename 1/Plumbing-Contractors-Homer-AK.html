<h3>Clogged Bathtub Drain in Homer Alaska</h2>

The Water Quality Association, a not-for-profit trade association for the water treatment market, has not had the ability to determine standards for these items and report inconsistent performance to date. Research has revealed no change occurs in the physical and chemical residential or commercial properties or the calcium ion concentration of water treated with the gadgets (The Water Quality Association Magnetics Task Force, 2001).</p>
<p>House water softeners, also called ion exchange units, are home appliances that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. Once the resin beads become filled with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium solution eliminates the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After passing through the beads, the resulting chloride option becomes a waste stream that decreases the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
