When tree roots begin to make their method inside someone's main sewer line, there is potential for this to trigger drain problems. The type of drain pipes already set up, such as cast iron, clay, plastic or copper, will identify the level of the damage that tree roots can trigger to a sewer line.</p>
<p>Drain clogs in bathroom sinks can occur in time from the accumulation of hair, littles soap and fibers from towels that builds up within pipes. As a clog ends up being bigger over time, it obstructs the pipe, stopping water from draining appropriately.
