<p>Backflow indicates the unfavorable turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the potable water supply; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from taking place. Points at which a potable water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, however they should be carefully created and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
