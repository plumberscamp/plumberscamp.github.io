<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a couple of things you can do to keep your drains clear. Prevent putting grease or oil down the drains. Utilize a service of baking soda and vinegar periodically to keep your drains and garbage disposal clean. You can use a natural drain cleaner month-to-month to keep your drains clear.

<p>The pipe-bursting technique is used on pipes that are seriously harmed, for replacing a whole pipe system, or for fixing larger areas of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to start repair, which includes two four foot square access pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers start by placing a "bursting head" at the gain access to point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is used to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its way through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and drawing in a new smooth pipe behind it.
