<p>Sewer linings can help to repair split pipes without needing to entirely replace your sewer lines or ruin the area around them. Daily usage should not trigger a water softener to leak. Leakages can also happen if you bump into the softener and scramble it, pulling the fitting apart. To prevent this from occurring, install the system in a steady and safe location. If you reside in an earthquake-prone area of the nation, protect the softener so that if the foundation begins moving, the softener doesn't fall over and rip out the plumbing. If your water softener is leaking throughout regeneration, you need to wait till after the cycle is completed and after that examined the system for fractures or broken fittings. You need to also inspect to ensure your drain line is never blocked up with debris. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener throughout regeneration and flood your basement or garage.</p>
