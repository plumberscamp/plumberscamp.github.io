At this point, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regeneration. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt service. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to utilize as soon as backwashing is total. Some water softeners will immediately change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch.

<p>Button Plumbing was great. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the previous. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was rather reasonable. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly happy with their service.</p>
