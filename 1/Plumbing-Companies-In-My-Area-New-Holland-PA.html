<p>Button Plumbing was great. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into.

I was very delighted with their service.</p>
