<p>The Phoenix Uniform Plumbing Code protects the general public water supply and personal on-site water supply and circulation systems by restricting cross-connections in between drinkable (ideal for drinking) and non-potable water systems, and by requiring installation of secondary and primary backflow prevention approaches. Secondary backflow methods provide an increased level of protection for the public water supply system.</p>
<p>The next requirements to examine is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is very important that the repair professional understands the correct installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly need to be installed in the installation orientation for which it was approved. The majority of backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, but it is necessary that the assembly just be installed if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work correctly and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work because the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
