<p>Sometimes, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces information on the functions of the assembly.

When an experienced tester translates the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
