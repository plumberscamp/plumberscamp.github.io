<h3>Qualities Of Good Emergency Plumbers Lewisburg WV</h3>
<p>These men were incredible! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue on and off for many years now. It was set up 7 years ago, and it never drained this well. I picked this company because they had fantastic evaluations and a reasonable cost, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a big, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did an excellent job cleaning up after it also.</p>
