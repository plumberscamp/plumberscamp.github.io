<p>A general rule is that you can recapture the cost of the repair if the problems happens well outside that 8 to 12 year life expectancy. If, state, you need a new burner set and the hot water heater is 5 years of ages, then it makes sense for you to invest the $120 for the part, particularly if you can do the work yourself. The closer the home appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limit, the more skeptical the economics of a repair becomes. The reason is that some other part on the appliance will go or its tank will leak. And there's no treatment for a leaking tank.</p>
<p>5. Pour hot water down your drain after utilizing the garbage disposal - In order to get rid of extraneous grease that can clog your kitchen sink, rinse your drain with a little bit of hot water. Whether tree roots have actually made their way into your pipes or you flushed something you shouldn't have, a clogged toilet is never a pleasant experience. Thankfully, you do not always need the help of a professional to fix it.</p>
