<p>Backflow Preventer: A device that permits water to go through it in one instructions, however prevents it from reversing in the opposite direction. You have long-term water hardness if you do not see limescale accumulation but rather see soap residue, your washing detergents not working as effectively or your skin getting sensitive and scratchy. If you smell gas, do not try to locate the leak. Instead, leave the house or structure right away.

<p>Filtration in sink taps and refrigerator water dispensers improves water's taste, however its high price makes it not practical as a household service.

A clogged sewer pipe could leave you ripe for a drain-cleaning scam.</p>
