<p>The brine tank help the water softening system in regeneration. It is a shorter tank that sits surrounding to the mineral tank. The salt water tank holds an extremely concentrated solution of salt (or often potassium) to bring back the resin beads' positive charge. Salt is by hand contributed to the salt water tank in the form of pellets or blocks. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve signs up the softening capacity of the resin is reducing, the heavy salt water service is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. The water passing through the system will no longer be softened if the brine tank runs out of salt.</p>
<p>Plainly the resin is not an endless exchange site. When all the salt exchange websites are changed with hardness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be worked on an alternate cycle called regrowth. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. Once backwashing is complete, the softener can be returned to use. Some water softeners will instantly change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
