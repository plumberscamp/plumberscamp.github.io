<h3>Efficient Services Of Plumber Upper Sandusky OH</h3>
<p>These people were incredible! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem on and off for years now. It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I chose this company since they had great evaluations and a fair rate, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a great task tidying up after it too.</p>
<p>Prior to we deem the task complete, we perform a follow-up camera inspection to ensure the drain and sewer cleaning was 100% reliable. If any difficult areas stay, we redo the job at no extra cost to you. We had some family pertaining to stay for graduation weekend and we required a brand-new hot water heater before they got here. We shopped around for a bit, however we got the best quotes from Blue Frog. They had the ability to send someone out within a day or so. He was extremely friendly and good. He said our costs must be lower now too.</p>
