<h3>How To Deal With A Plumbing Emergency Central Point OR</h3>
<p>These men were amazing! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem on and off for several years now. It was set up 7 years back, and it never drained this well. I selected this company due to the fact that they had great reviews and a reasonable rate, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a big, disgusting mess on their hands (actually), and they did an excellent job cleaning up after it also.</p>
<p>With all of these elements and more, it's safe to state that running water is a requirement in any house.
