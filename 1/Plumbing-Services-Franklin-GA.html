Water pressure might fail or be decreased when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is unexpectedly high demand on the water supply (for instance, when several fire hydrants are opened). Lowered pressure in the pipe might enable polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
