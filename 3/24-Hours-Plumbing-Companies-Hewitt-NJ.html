<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of several afflicted areas of the plumbing below the slab.

Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost really quickly. This is the main reason we will suggest a complete repipe in specific communities, based on our experience.</p>
