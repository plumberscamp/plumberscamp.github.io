<p>If you have actually always lived in an area with tough water, you may not understand how much it impacts you-- however if you have actually just recently moved from an area with soft water, you're most likely all too aware of the dry, inflamed skin and frizzy, dull hair that can result from tough water. Hard water disrupts the lathering of soaps and hair shampoos, triggering you to utilize more. Hard water also makes it more difficult to clean soap off your body, or shampoo out of your hair, which can lead to dandruff and irritation of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely find that difficult water causes your skin to flake, itch, and turn red frequently.</p>
