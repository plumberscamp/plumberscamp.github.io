<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Fed Up With False Guarantees? Water circulates in the tank where tiny resin beads swap the calcium and magnesium in the water for the salt or potassium they're holding. The beads act as a sponge, adsorbing the firmness minerals from your water. This process is described as ion exchange, and soft water is the outcome. When the resin beads have maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a process called regeneration). Throughout this procedure, the resin beads are cleaned with the extremely concentrated saltwater service (brine) from the tank (made from the salt you contributed to the tank). The salt water requires the calcium and magnesium ions to be launched from the beads and changed with salt or potassium ions.</p>

The study included tests that removed tough soils, in addition to assessing spotting and recording. Researchers discovered that softened water utilizes practically 30% less detergent, but cleans up as well as water at 10 gpg hardness level. When comparing soft water with water at a 25 gpg level, that cleaning agent cost savings rises to almost 70%.</p>
