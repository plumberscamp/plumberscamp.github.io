<p>Note: Difficult water stops your washing detergent from working efficiently because difficult water ions can bond with cleaning agent particles to deactivate them. You, therefore, need to use more and more detergent to attain the same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt service. Hard minerals captured in the resin (or zeolite) are released and the media gets renewed with salt ions. The water softener is also cleaned and disinfected during regrowth. Finally, water containing the tough minerals and other waste gets flushed out of the system.</p>
