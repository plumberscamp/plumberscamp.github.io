<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a couple of things you can do to keep your drains clear. Avoid putting grease or oil down the drains. Utilize a service of baking soda and vinegar occasionally to keep your drains and garbage disposal clean. You can use a natural drain cleaner regular monthly to keep your drains clear. We recommend organic items, such as Bio-Clean, because they work much better than products including severe chemicals and won't cause damage to your drains or components.</p>

<p>In some households, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to approach when searching for a viable solution, particularly when easy plunging does not seem to work. Nevertheless, there are numerous downsides to using these harmful items - not least of which is that they typically include substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing an obstruction, which can vary from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little things, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of providing the threat of damage to your house and family.</p>
