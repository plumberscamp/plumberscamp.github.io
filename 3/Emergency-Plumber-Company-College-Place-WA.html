<h3>Plumbing Company Serving College Place WA</h3>
<p>The most reliable method to address hard water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the firmness ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When tough water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>A leaky waste disposal unit can be fixed if you can locate the part that's resulting in the issue.

<p>Your waste disposal unit guarantees that your sink and plumbing fixtures don't get clogged. Contrary to some people's understanding, waste disposal unit do not include blades. Instead, a waste disposal unit includes 2 fixed bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk. When the disposal is switched on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts force food and particles to grind against a fixed mill along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action effectively crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without obstructing.</p>
