These systems are non-electric and are essentially maintenance-free.</p>
<p>In addition to water softening systems, Rinckey stated that reverse osmosis systems (ROs) are quite popular with homeowners in the area. He kept in mind that there are particular contaminants that citizens are dealing with and an RO can help ease those issues. Due to being mainly agricultural in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some property owners are installing ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are an item of agricultural waste. Rinckey kept in mind that these systems get rid of around 94 percent of nitrates. Arsenic also naturally occurs in some soils which too can be fixed with the right RO system.</p>
<p>A cross-connection is any irreversible or temporary connection in between a public water system or customer's drinkable (i.e., drinking) water system and any source or system consisting of nonpotable water or other substances. An example is the piping in between a public water supply or customer's drinkable water supply and an auxiliary water supply, cooling system or irrigation system.</p>
