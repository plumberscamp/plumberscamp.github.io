<p>Aside from these two crucial parts, there are a myriad of little, maybe less crucial things that can break or deteriorate. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away much more quickly. Consistent gross smells originating from the toilet can suggest you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting appropriately, you might need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and trigger a leak. Tank lids can split and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed if mishandled. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it definitely doesn't do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by discussing all the things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a complete component and every part needs to be in excellent shape for it to work at its best.</p>

This rust can lead to an accumulation of lead, which can have lots of unfavorable effects on your health. Rusty pipes also lead to bad water quality and low water pressure.</p>
