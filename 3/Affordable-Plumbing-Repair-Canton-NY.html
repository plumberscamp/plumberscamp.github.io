Tough water hinders the lathering of soaps and hair shampoos, causing you to use more. Difficult water also makes it more difficult to wash soap off your body, or hair shampoo out of your hair, which can result in dandruff and irritation of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely find that tough water triggers your skin to flake, itch, and turn red often.</p>

<p>Kitchen sinks are constantly susceptible to clogs with food and grease being the major culprits. If fats are poured down the sink, they harden to the piping walls. Food follows the grease down the plumbing, connecting to the walls as well. Even tree roots can create serious drain clogs by wrapping around pipes. Their crushing strength stops the water flow, requiring plumbers to discover and repair the issue for typical house plumbing operations. If this is what is occurring to your home, you need your drain cleaned up prior to it causes more damage and even costlier repairs.</p>
