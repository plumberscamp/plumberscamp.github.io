The salt water tank holds an extremely focused option of salt (or in some cases potassium) to bring back the resin beads' favorable charge. Salt is manually contributed to the brine tank in the kind of blocks or pellets. These dissolve in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capability of the resin is lessening, the heavy brine solution is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank.
