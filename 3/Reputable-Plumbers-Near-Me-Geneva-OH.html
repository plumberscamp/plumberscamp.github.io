Repiping plumbing lines in your home is a big task - and it's a job you want to solve. However the range of plumbing pipe materials to choose from can make it complicated. Here we look at some of the attributes of the significant pipe types to help you choose the ideal pipe for your plumbing.</p>
<p>Often, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates data on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to know what the field test data implies for that particular assembly.  When a qualified tester analyzes the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
