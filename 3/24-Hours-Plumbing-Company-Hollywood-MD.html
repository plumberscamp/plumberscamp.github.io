<p>Water softening uses a procedure called "ion exchange" to eliminate liquified hard water minerals such as calcium, iron, magnesium and manganese. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular reaction is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that keep sodium, and as the tough water streams through the resin, the sodium is swapped for the hard water minerals. The difficult water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace quantity of salt flows out with the softened water.</p>
<p>Home water softeners, also called ion exchange systems, are home appliances that eliminate calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium. As soon as the resin beads become filled with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium service eliminates the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After going through the beads, the resulting chloride option ends up being a waste stream that decreases the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
