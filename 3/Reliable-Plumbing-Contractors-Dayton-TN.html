<p>Some makers claim that the electrical devices they produce can impact the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surface areas. Given that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like standard water softeners do, one benefit declared for the user is the removal of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant growth promo have been claimed, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just change the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of particular systems has actually shown a decrease of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
