<h3>Plumber Work Scope And Its Specialization Weston WV</h3>
<p>The use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic corrosion Direct contact between dissimilar metals will start the formation of a galvanic cell, which is produced whenever two different kinds of metal are conductively connected to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is developed since of the process. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe. It is also worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not completely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to alleviate this direct contact in between the different metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating product that physically separates contact between the two metals.</p>
