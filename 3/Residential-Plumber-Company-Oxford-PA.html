Leakages can likewise happen if you bump into the softener and jostle it, pulling the fitting apart. To prevent this from happening, install the unit in a steady and safe area. If you live in an earthquake-prone area of the country, secure the softener so that if the foundation begins moving, the softener does not tip over and remove the plumbing. You need to wait until after the cycle is completed and then checked the system for fractures or broken fittings if your water softener is leaking during regrowth. You need to also check to make sure your drain line is never blocked up with debris. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener throughout regrowth and flood your basement or garage.</p>
