A toilet's tank is composed of multiple small moving parts, such as flapper valves and fill valves, that need to be changed or fixed due to their frequent use. When these parts wear out, they lead to small leaks that are hard to see with the naked eye. This is why it is essential to call a plumber as quickly as you suspect you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not only does a leaking toilet drainage, it can also result in flooding and water damage.</p>
