<p>Clearly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange site. When all the salt exchange websites are replaced with hardness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regrowth. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. Once backwashing is complete, the softener can be returned to use. Some water softeners will immediately change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 highlights both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
