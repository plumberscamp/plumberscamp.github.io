If, say, you need a brand-new burner kit and the water heater is five years of ages, then it makes good sense for you to invest the $120 for the part, particularly if you can do the work yourself. The closer the appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limitation, the more skeptical the economics of a repair becomes.
