The majority of commercial use backflow prevention setups make use of a valve system that connects with the irrigation line within your company, where irrigation fulfills the main water supply. From here, the preventer can keep an eye on the movement of water within your system, and avoid any potential back-pressure and back-siphonage that might be brought on by malfunctioning plumbing devices.

Instead, once they decrease your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. Anything you put down there won't go through when something obstructs the pipes.</p>
