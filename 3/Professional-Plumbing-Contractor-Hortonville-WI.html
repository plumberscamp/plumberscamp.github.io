<p>Changing your sink is a step-by-step process. Measure, cut, and link the pipes. Before connecting any pipes to your water softener, measure and cut your pipes to fit.

Plastic tubing like PEX can also be used. Though it may need extra adapters, versatile tubing is far easier to deal with and can utilize push-to-connect fittings, conserving you time and the trouble of soldering.</p>
