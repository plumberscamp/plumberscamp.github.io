<p>Salt Water Valve - Controls water flow in and out of salt tank. Features automated shut-off to avoid overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is almost certainly from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water material of LP or natural gas is very low. Rainwater which has actually not infiltrated the earth is a remarkably pure form of water. When water vaporizes it leaves liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. Therefore when evaporated water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>

Waste disposal unit can weigh 15 pounds. or more. That's a great deal of weight to suddenly capture with one hand while you're turning the lower installing bracket with the other hand.</p>
<p>Eventually, however, the beads reach optimal capacity and can't draw in anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank must be regenerated, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank comes in. An on-board computer computes the quantity of water that streams through the softener. Regrowth instantly starts when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom home and family of 4, regeneration usually occurs every 12,000 gallons.</p>
