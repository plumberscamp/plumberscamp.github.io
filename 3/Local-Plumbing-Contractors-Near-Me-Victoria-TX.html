<p>In some families, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to approach when looking for a viable service, especially when basic plunging doesn't appear to work. Nevertheless, there are lots of drawbacks to utilizing these harmful items - not least of which is that they usually consist of substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering an obstruction, which can vary from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life.
