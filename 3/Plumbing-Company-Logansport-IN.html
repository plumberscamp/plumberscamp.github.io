<p>As soon as the elements are placed back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is prepared to be pressurized. It is essential to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the downside shut down stays in the closed position. This enables the parts to transfer to their pressurized positions in an accurate motion. When the assembly is pressurized, then any accumulated air needs to be gotten rid of from the body.

When these parts break, they lead to tiny leakages that are difficult to see with the naked eye.

If a fire happens, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then allows water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
