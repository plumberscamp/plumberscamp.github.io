These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular response is required. Water softeners have resin beads that keep salt, and as the tough water streams through the resin, the salt is switched for the tough water minerals. The tough water minerals are trapped in a trace and the softener amount of sodium drains with the softened water.</p>

Some house owners will attempt to dislodge the clog using store-bought drain cleaners and natural natural home remedy, like vinegar or lemon juice with baking soda. These treatments do work, particularly if you are dealing with a little drain clog. However, they are generally short-term repairs that do not provide permanent resolutions.</p>
