<p>Backflow means the unfavorable turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean supply of water; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a safe and clean water system gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they should be thoroughly created and set up to avoid backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
