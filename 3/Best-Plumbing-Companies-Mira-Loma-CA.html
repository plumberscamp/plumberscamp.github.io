<p>Deluge systems are developed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems generally are set up in locations where the possibility of an extreme fire condition is likely, such as airplane garages. Water to the system is held back by the deluge valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire happens, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then allows water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>

<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod, gently listen and raise the rod. If the water shuts off, you may have the ability to stop the running by adjusting the float.
