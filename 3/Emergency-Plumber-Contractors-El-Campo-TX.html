Galvanized steel (often known simply as "galv" or "iron" in the plumbing trade) is relatively costly, and tough to deal with due to weight and requirement of a pipe threader It stays in common use for repair of existing "galv" systems and to satisfy building regulations non-combustibility requirements generally discovered in hotels, apartment and other commercial applications. It is also extremely resilient and resistant to mechanical abuse. Black lacquered steel pipe is the most widely utilized pipe material for fire sprinklers and gas.</p>
