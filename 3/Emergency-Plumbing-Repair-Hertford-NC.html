For an outdoor gas light or device whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can cause an obstruction or can cause deterioration that blocks the line. Simply 4" of water pressure can be enough to block a natural gas line. Noise-- In time sediment can build up in the bottom of your tank. This sediment eventually gets difficult and eliminates from the capability of your water heater. This solidified sediment is likely the source of the noise.</p>
