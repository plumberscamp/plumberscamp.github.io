Some items that should never be taken into the disposal include fats, oils, grease, egg shells, potatoes, coffee grinds, rice, and bones.</p>
<p>For plumbing work other that repair or replacement fixtures, a structure authorization is generally required before a plumbing license can be released. Soften only what you need to.
