<h2>Tips To Hire Emergency Plumbing Service in Whitehouse Station</h2>

<p>The Plumbing and Gas Piping Program IVR system is now accepting inspection demands. CenterPoint Energy's Home Service Plus uses you an optional Pipe Protection Prepare for just $3.95 a month. It covers interior, easily accessible, gas pipes running from the gas meter to your gas home appliances. Auto-reverse setting: Some garbage disposals include this setting, which reverses the instructions the blades spin to clear waste. This protects the blades so they don't wear out as fast.</p>
<p>The person who does the testing must be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not needed to get this certification. I have actually checked with a couple of plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing ranged from $150 - $250, however I would anticipate the rate to be substantially less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
