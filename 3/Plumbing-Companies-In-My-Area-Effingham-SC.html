<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water supply pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean water supply pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
