<h3>Quality Plumbing Service Riverview FL</h3>
<p>As the water treatment market has grown in the U.S., the concept of water softening has often been misinterpreted as a purifying, cleaning or conditioning process. This is due mostly to overstated advertising and, in part, to consumer mistaken beliefs about water treatment. However the reality is that water softening simply removes hardness minerals and removes problems that are an annoyance and not a threat to human health. The decision "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of individual preference not need. However, water softening does have benefits, and drawbacks, that make this choice a significant one.</p>
<p>Was your home developed prior to the 1970s and has not gone through remodeling or pipe replacement? If so, it is most likely that your pipes are made of galvanized metal or another product which has worn away and decomposed over the years. Older pipes can cause significant leaks and even infect your water as they decay. Even the highest quality pipes will not last forever and will need to be changed.</p>
