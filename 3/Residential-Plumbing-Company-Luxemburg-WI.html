<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable supply of water pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable water supply pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
