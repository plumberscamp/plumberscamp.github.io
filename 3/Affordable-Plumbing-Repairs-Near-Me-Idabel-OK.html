Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on.
