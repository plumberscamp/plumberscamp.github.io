<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable water system pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>

<p>Letters are sent to residential customers with recognized backflow devices on an annual basis.
