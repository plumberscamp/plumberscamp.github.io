<p>Your kitchen sink is an important part of your house, which makes its plumbing's effective functioning a requirement more than a need. As soon as the test results show the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated during the repair procedure. It is very important that the plumbing system be turned on extremely slowly to ensure no damage is done to the piping system. As soon as the system is pressurized, air must be removed from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system should be checked to make sure no valves were mistakenly left open or did not close appropriately. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are completely open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has been returned to service.</p>
