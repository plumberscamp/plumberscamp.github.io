Only a licensed plumber can perform test and installation of brand-new gas lines.</p>
<p>Changing the old disposal with a similar new one is less complicated than changing with a various model. So, if you are not looking particularly for a various disposal this may be something to think about. A completely different disposal, or for installing your first disposal, the sink adapter needs to be puttied into place. A secure seal is a must. Once linked at the sink drain, the dishwasher adapter is connected. The last thing is to wire up the brand-new disposal, taking care to connect wires precisely, and the base covered to protect the electrical wiring from any water getting in.</p>
<p>Though it's not constantly essential, sometimes the plumber might have to repair or upgrade circuitry to power the new waste disposal unit. This normally costs an extra $50 to $100+. The pilot burner might need to be relit, the gas line may be clogged or need repair. The flowers or greenery near the gas leak will be discolored or deteriorated if the gas line is damaged. Contact our specialists to determine the degree of the problem.</p>
