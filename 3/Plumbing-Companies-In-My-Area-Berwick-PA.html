Residences built in the first part of the 1900s were plumbed using lead pipes. At that time, people had no idea that the lead in the pipes might seep into the drinking water, not to mention the health risks connected with lead.</p>
<p>Lots of homeowners will utilize a store-bought chemical drain cleaner to resolve their dirty or clogged drain problems. These chemicals are easy to use and economical, however they harm your pipes and their effects are just short term. Store-bought liquid drain cleaners use severe chemicals to gnaw at the clog and with repeated use, these chemicals will also gnaw at the pipe producing weak spots that are prone to burst. This is why professional drain cleaning from a drain cleaning company is constantly suggested.</p>
<p>A backflow preventer is a method or mechanism to prevent backflow. The basic means of preventing backflow is an air space, which either eliminates a cross-connection or supplies a barrier to backflow. The standard mechanism for preventing backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which provides a physical barrier to backflow. The primary types of mechanical backflow preventers are the reduced-pressure principle assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the double check valve assembly.</p>
