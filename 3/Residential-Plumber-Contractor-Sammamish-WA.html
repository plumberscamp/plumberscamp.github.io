Because these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like traditional water softeners do, one benefit declared for the user is the elimination of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant development promotion have been declared, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just alter the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of specific systems has actually shown a reduction of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" however rather "water conditioning".</p>
