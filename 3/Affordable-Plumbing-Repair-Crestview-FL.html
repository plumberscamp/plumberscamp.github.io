Sanford & Son plumbing supplies sink repair and replacement services to all Lake Elsinore, Temecula, Murrieta, Sun City, Menifee, Wildomar, and surrounding locations. During regeneration, salted water from the brine tank streams up the fill tube and into the softener tank.

The system then reverts back to softening the inbound water.</p>
