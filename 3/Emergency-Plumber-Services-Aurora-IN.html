<h3>Plumber Plumbing Contractor Aurora IN</h3>
<p>As the water treatment market has grown in the U.S., the principle of water softening has often been misconstrued as a purifying, cleansing or conditioning procedure. This is due mostly to exaggerated advertising and, in part, to consumer misunderstandings about water treatment. However the truth is that water softening just removes solidity minerals and gets rid of problems that are an annoyance and not a threat to human health. The decision "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of personal preference not necessity. Nevertheless, water softening does have advantages, and drawbacks, that make this choice a substantial one.</p>
<p>If the sound of your toilet continuously running is typical to you, then you've got a problem with over-running or leaking. This water is being discarded down the overflow tube losing approximately 200 gallons of water per day. That takes a toll on your water expense, not to point out the risk of a more major leak that might ruin your house with flooding.</p>
