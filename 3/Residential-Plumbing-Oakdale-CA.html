Further, it must be set up in accordance with plumbing codes, maker requirements, and engineering guidelines for the type of system to be used.</p>
<p>Requirements in NFPA 13: Requirement for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems for installing backflow preventers and in NFPA 25: Requirement for the Inspection, Testing and Maintenance of Water-Based Fire Defense Systems for carrying out annual forward flow tests are often viewed as a mandate to have them.
