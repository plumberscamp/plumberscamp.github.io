<p>If you do not have a plumber's snake, you can use a wire coat hanger by aligning it.

If you can reach it, place it into the kitchen drain or stub pipe to press through or pull out the clog. Beware not to scratch your sink with the wire.</p>

When something blocks the pipes, anything you put down there won't go through.</p>
