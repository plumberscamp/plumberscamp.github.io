<p>There's a great possibility you have galvanized pipes if you have an older house. And if your home was built in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are most likely nearing the end of their life expectancy. As galvanized pipes age, they start to corrode. This deterioration can result in an accumulation of lead, which can have many negative effects on your health. Rusty pipes also lead to poor water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the tough water is softened. The water system line feeds the tough water into the tank. The water permeates through the bed of resin beads, depositing the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and streams through your pipes and out to your household devices. Backflow is a term used in the plumbing world to describe an undesirable flow of water in the reverse instructions. The backflow of water brings contaminants back to the primary water system system, making the water in it unsafe to drink.</p>
