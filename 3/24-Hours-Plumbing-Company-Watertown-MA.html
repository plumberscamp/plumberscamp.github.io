Our repair processes rely on having a clean, smooth pipeline, otherwise, imperfections caused by waste buildup can prevent the liner from sticking to the walls appropriately. We clean the sewer lines with hydro jetting, a service that allows for an extensive cleaning by blasting streams of hot, pressurized water straight into the line. The special nozzle attached to the hose directs the water in all directions to permit the water to cover the whole diameter of the sewer line and offer a mindful cleaning.</p>
