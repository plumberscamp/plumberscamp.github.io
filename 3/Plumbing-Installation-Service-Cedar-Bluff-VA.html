The membrane has pores large enough to admit water particles for passage; solidity ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft supply of water is without hardness ions without any other ions being added. Membranes are a kind of water filter needing routine cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
