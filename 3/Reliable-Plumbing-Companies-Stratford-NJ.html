<p>As soon as the components are placed back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is ready to be pressurized. It is important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the downside shut off stays in the closed position. This permits the parts to move to their pressurized positions in a precise motion. When the assembly is pressurized, then any collected air must be removed from the body.
