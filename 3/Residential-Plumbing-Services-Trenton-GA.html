To install another weld-type drain, such as this 2-Inch Sioux Chief PVC Drain (available at SupplyHouse ), you'll want to assemble and dry fit all the connections before you glue them together.">

<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the past. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather reasonable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly happy with their service.</p>
