If there is a break in the line, the camera not only confirms the location of the break but permits you to see the nature of the break, too. A camera can also be utilized to aesthetically check the condition of a sewer line when planning to connect another sewer into the line. It can also be used for pre-house sales or whenever the need arises to confirm that a sewer remains in good condition.</p>
