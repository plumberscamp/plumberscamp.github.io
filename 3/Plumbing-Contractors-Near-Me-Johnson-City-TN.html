For one, they might harm your pipes and on a bigger scale, these chemicals aren't eco-friendly.

<p>Don't put whatever down your waste disposal unit. It's important to watch what you put down your waste disposal unit.

Fruit and vegetable peels can also trigger jams and obstructions - think about composting or positioning these products in the garbage. In addition, grease and oil can harden and collect in your drain too. After completing cooking, consider putting leftover grease or oil into a jar or bowl to reserve. You can then utilize and reheat for other cooking or easily location in the garbage after it's hardened.</p>
