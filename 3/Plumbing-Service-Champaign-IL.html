<h3>Emergency Plumber & 24 Hour Plumbing Services Champaign IL</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation requires the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed signed up architect (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you determine if your building needs a backflow preventer or multiple devices, or if you receive an exemption. Exemptions, which are given in extremely unusual cases where the building is considered to not present a risk to the water system, should be submitted with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you need to have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, as well as an initial test report of the device for DEP review.</p>
<p>If you're considering changing to a tankless hot water heater, it's a good concept to weigh the pros and cons of this advanced choice. While tankless water heaters are terrific in lots of respects, they are not perfect for everyone. For example, households with a great deal of member of the family or roomies, along with those that require more than typical quantities of hot water daily, will most likely benefit more from a standard tank hot water heater.</p>
