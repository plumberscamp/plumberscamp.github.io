<p>Echologics has a long history of developing acclaimed acoustic technologies for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (normally from your house to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be used to evaluate the type and condition of underground pipes, and to determine problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, blockages, corrosion or collapsed pipes. Homeowners might have a video inspection done to find the reason for periodic sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when selling or purchasing an older home.</p>

<p>Drawbacks to be familiar with is that hybrid water heaters need to be set up in an area that stays in between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need up to 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, due to the fact that the heatpump is on top of the water heater. Also, hybrids need approximately 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled area to record sufficient heat from the air, and a drain in close distance to release the condensate.</p>
