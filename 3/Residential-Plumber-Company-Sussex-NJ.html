<h3>How To Select A Credible Plumber Sussex NJ</h3>
<p>Another common argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves need to prevent backflow.  The obvious issue with this is that if the backflow occurs at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic manually run valve must stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if completely closed, has good seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless most of the automated valves, such as the electric solenoid valves utilized for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and completely closed.</p>
