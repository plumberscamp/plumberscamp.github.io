<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a worn flapper is usually the offender. But not constantly. First, look at the chain that raises the flapper. If there's excessive slack in the chain, it can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing firmly. A chain with insufficient slack can trigger trouble too. Picture 3 demonstrates how to set the slack perfect.</p>
<p>Usually, the cost to replace a toilet ranges in between $ 122 and $228, with a lot of house owners investing around $ 150 to $180. This does not consist of the cost of the toilet, which averages $ 99 to $199, for a total toilet replacement cost of $ 221 to $427. A high-efficiency toilet with extra functions can cost $ 800 to $1,500 to install. The average installation takes a plumber 2 to 4 hours at $ 65 per hour. If you're changing an existing toilet, include $ 30 to $50 to eliminate your old toilet.</p>
<p>For example, a plumber on a forum sponsored by tool manufacturer Ridgid reports charging $125 for a camera inspection done as part of cleaning out a sewer line with a cable television and cutting blade (called snaking) or $225 if done individually. And video inspection rates at Allied Drain Cleaning 1 in Connecticut start at $175, while Covenant Pipeline 2 in California charges a minimum of $275 for up to 2 hours and $175 per hour for each additional hour.</p>
