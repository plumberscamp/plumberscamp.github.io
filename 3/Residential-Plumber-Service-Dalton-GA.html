<p>The most reliable way to address tough water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When hard water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Drains clog for a reason, however it's not always obvious. It is highly suggested that a professional plumber perform a camera inspection on a main sewer line after it has clogged. This is two times as essential if you're buying a home. Think of in the above situation knowing the condition of the line prior to the purchase of a home. You can't always be specific whether the house has actually had drainage problems, and if so, whether the previous house owner knew the reason for the clog A simple camera inspection might make you knowledgeable about a extremely pricey and hidden issue prior to the purchase.</p>
