Area 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of seclusion backflow preventers (BFP) and Area 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses protection of the safe and clean water system within a structure these devices are known as seclusion" BFP. Again, the very best type of backflow prevention is an air space, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would stream over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to ensure there is an air gap, if there is no chance to provide one, then we check to see that the proper BFP device is installed. These BFP's, if testable, are required to be tested (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and at least every twelve months afterwards.</p>
<p>This post will briefly discuss (1) the important points in performing plumbing inspection; (2) 15 effective plumbing maintenance suggestions; (3) technology used to improve plumbing inspection processes; and (4) free plumbing lists you can utilize and customize.
