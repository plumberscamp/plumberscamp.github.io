<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the homes in our area were constructed prior to 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water became basic. Older homes were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that comes in contact with water and oxygen will wear away. This rust, or rust, causes the iron to swell up and become flaky. In order to prevent the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and creates a waterproof membrane to secure the iron from rusting.</p>
<p>Is your home 50+ years old? Up through the mid-twentieth century, galvanized steel was the primary product used in plumbing. While galvanized steel is strong, it generally catches deterioration after about 50 years and requires replacement. Even more modern pipes won't last forever, so watch on plumbing systems that could be reaching the end of their life-span.</p>
