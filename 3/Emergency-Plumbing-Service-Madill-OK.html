Water distributes in the tank where tiny resin beads swap the calcium and magnesium in the water for the sodium or potassium they're holding. The beads serve as a sponge, adsorbing the solidity minerals from your water. This process is referred to as ion exchange, and soft water is the outcome. When the resin beads have maxed out their capability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a procedure called regrowth). Throughout this process, the resin beads are cleaned with the highly concentrated saltwater option (brine) from the tank (made from the salt you contributed to the tank). The salt water requires the calcium and magnesium ions to be released from the beads and changed with sodium or potassium ions.</p>
