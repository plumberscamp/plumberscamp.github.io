As useful as this gas is, the features that make this gas dangerous is its odorless and colorless nature, which makes it a silent killer. Nevertheless, to prevent off that hazard, mercaptans are included into gas, which provides it a rotten egg odor and makes it detectable when leaking. Ensure to just trust an utmost professional with your gas line repair in Richmond.</p>
