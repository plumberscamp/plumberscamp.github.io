<p>As a locally-owned service, integrity and responsibility are exceptionally essential to developing a track record for excellence. Area 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of isolation backflow preventers (BFP) and Section 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses defense of the safe and clean water system within a building these gadgets are known as seclusion" BFP. Again, the best type of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would stream over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to make sure there is an air gap, if there is no other way to provide one, then we examine to see that the correct BFP device is set up. These BFP's, if testable, are needed to be evaluated (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and at least every twelve months thereafter.</p>
