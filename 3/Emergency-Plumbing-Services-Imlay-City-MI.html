You, for that reason, have to use more and more cleaning agent to attain the very same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt service. Difficult minerals captured in the resin (or zeolite) are released and the media gets renewed with salt ions. The water softener is likewise cleaned up and sanitized throughout regeneration. Finally, water consisting of the difficult minerals and other waste gets eliminated of the system.</p>
