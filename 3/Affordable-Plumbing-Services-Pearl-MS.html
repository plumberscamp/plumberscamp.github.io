<p>Echologics has a long history of developing acclaimed acoustic innovations for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a camera through the household sewer pipes (normally from your home to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be utilized to evaluate the type and condition of underground pipes, and to recognize problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, obstructions, deterioration or collapsed pipes. Homeowners may have a video inspection done to find the cause of regular sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when selling or purchasing an older home.</p>
<p>During sewer camera inspection, a Bob Oates technician inserts a high-resolution camera with a light connected to it into the sewer line at your residential or commercial property. The camera is manually controlled on a flexible rod, or driven through the pipes on a tractor. The high-resolution light supplies a clear image for the professional to accurately examine conditions and identify the functionality of the pipes. The details we obtain from the inspection permits us to make an informed choice relating to the condition of your pipes and advise the very best option too. If the pipe needs to be cleaned up of clogs or relined with epoxy resin, we can make the perfect suggestion with self-confidence.</p>
