Examine to see if there is an accumulation of mineral deposits in the tank, if possible. Mineral deposits can decide on the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will indicate that less water will be heated and readily available for use. Also, rust of the tank's components can trigger the tank to have a short life. Request that a new one be set up if the water heater is old or you see apparent indications of corrosion.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the past. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was rather sensible. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very happy with their service.</p>
