<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable water system pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
