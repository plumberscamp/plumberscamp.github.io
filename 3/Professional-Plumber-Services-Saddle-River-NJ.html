<p>When the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and examined and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some parts might have extremely tight tolerances that need to be preserved. An important thing to determine on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the component. The guide is a very important part of the design of each part. If the component is not fixed appropriately, the guide could limit the motion (rather than direct or constant) of the component, which might trigger the part to not work to its capabilities. Often times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. For the most part the guides are restricting the travel of the part causing lower test outcomes than what is required.</p>
