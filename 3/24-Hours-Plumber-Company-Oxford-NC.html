<p>E.R. Services understands the value of preserving the stability and efficiency of your kitchen. Sediment Accumulation: If you see unusual popping, banging, or clanging noises originating from your unit, this could be a sign that sediment has actually developed in your tank, and is causing a reaction with the heating aspect. Lacking warm water quickly is another indication of sediment build-up, since the sediment is using up more space in the tank, so your water for that reason takes longer to heat. To fix this problem, you will likely need to flush out the tank.</p>
