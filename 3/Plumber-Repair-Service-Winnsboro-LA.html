<p>As soon as the parts are placed back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is all set to be pressurized. It is necessary to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the downside shut off remains in the closed position. This permits the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in an accurate movement. As soon as the assembly is pressurized, then any collected air must be gotten rid of from the body. The majority of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from critical areas in the assembly.
