<p>Your kitchen sink is an integral part of your house, which makes its plumbing's effective operating a need more than a need. When the test results show the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated during the repair process. It is essential that the plumbing system be turned on very gradually to ensure no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air must be eliminated from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system must be inspected to guarantee no valves were mistakenly left open or did not close appropriately. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are entirely open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has been gone back to service.</p>

<p>A. Usually wax doesn't "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undetected issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
