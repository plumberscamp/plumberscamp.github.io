The direct exposure to carbon monoxide is so deadly that anybody who inhales it requires instant medical attention. The Centers for Illness Control and Prevention exposed that 5149 people died from carbon monoxide gas poisoning in between 1999 and 2010. To prevent this disaster, ensure to use your gas ranges precisely as instructed and never ever to use them to heat your home. The very same goes for portable gas ranges, which are to be utilized outdoors just and not indoors. When running the space-heaters, make sure someone is awake to monitor them.
