If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undiscovered problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
