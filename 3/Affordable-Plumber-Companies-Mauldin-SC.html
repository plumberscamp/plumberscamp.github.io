<p>A reduced pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is installed in high danger" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but likewise has a 3rd check valve that is in fact a vent open up to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is utilized in high-risk scenarios is since if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens.
