<p>A. Generally wax doesn't "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" unnoticed issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
