This can require the safe and clean water to reverse its direction of circulation through the cross-connection between the two systems. Potential contaminants can then enter the safe and clean water supply. The best method to minimize build-up is have a professional flush it at least once a year.

Given that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like standard water softeners do, one advantage declared for the user is the elimination of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant development promo have been declared, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just change the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of particular systems has actually revealed a decrease of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
