<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumber Fort Myers FL</h3>
<p>These men were amazing! They appeared early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem on and off for several years now. It was installed 7 years earlier, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company because they had great reviews and a fair rate, and although the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a big, horrible mess on their hands (literally), and they did a terrific job cleaning up after it too.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the previous. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather sensible. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely delighted with their service.</p>
