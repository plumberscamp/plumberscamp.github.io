<p>Nearly all softeners fall into one of two classifications. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regrow on a fixed schedule and after that go back to service. These work well for families that are on regular water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt since they regrow whether the resin requires it or not. Demand-control designs, with either mechanical and electrical sensing units, usually regrow after numerous gallons of water have been softened. Such models are practical if you have an ever-changing water use schedule.</p>
