The choice "to soften or not to soften" refers personal preference not need. Nevertheless, water softening does have advantages, and downsides, that make this decision a substantial one.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the previous. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was quite sensible. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely pleased with their service.</p>
