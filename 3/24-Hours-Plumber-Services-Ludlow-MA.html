<p>There's a great opportunity you have galvanized pipes if you have an older house. And if your home was built in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are most likely nearing the end of their life expectancy. As galvanized pipes age, they start to rust. This corrosion can result in an accumulation of lead, which can have many negative impacts on your health. Rusty pipes also cause bad water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>Sometimes, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates data on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to know what the field test information indicates for that specific assembly.  When a skilled tester analyzes the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
