<p>Plainly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange website. When all the sodium exchange sites are changed with hardness minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be worked on an alternate cycle called regrowth. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt service. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. Once backwashing is complete, the softener can be returned to use. Some water softeners will automatically change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 highlights both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
