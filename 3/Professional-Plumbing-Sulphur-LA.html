<p>The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania presently has no licensure or certification requirements for most construction contractors (or their employees). The secret to the innovation is having the ability to control both the crystal development rate and their elimination from our polymer beads, thereby getting rid of solidity ions and producing a water softening advantage that does not require replacement chemicals or regrowth of active sites," specified Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and primary technology officer. This technology is more cost reliable and lasts longer than common water softening items such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>
<p>Each element of the assembly must be tested to identify what needs repair. The field test might not constantly show you the seriousness of the failure or whether repair parts beyond the fundamental rubber repair kit are needed. There may be extra test treatments, beyond those developed in the tester certification program, that can supply data revealing the severity of the failure that might assist in the diagnostic analysis of the backflow prevention assembly.</p>

Camera work in finding buried septic tanks or inspecting the condition of buried pipes to identify proper maintenance schedules or the degree of required repairs.
