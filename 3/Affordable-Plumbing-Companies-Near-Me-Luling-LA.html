<p>Backflow suggests the unwanted reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable supply of water; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from happening. Points at which a potable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they must be carefully designed and installed to prevent backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
