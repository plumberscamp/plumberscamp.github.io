<p>Examine the washer for wear or fractures when you remove the cap to flush out the valve. Replacing a bad washer is simple and cheap. However finding the right washer may not be. The most typical washers are typically available at home centers and hardware shops. Other styles can be hard to discover. Remove it and take it to the shop to discover a match if you choose to hunt for a washer. Plumbers usually replace the whole fill valve instead of hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a worn flapper is typically the offender. However not constantly. First, look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing firmly if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with too little slack can trigger problem too. Picture 3 demonstrates how to set the slack ideal.</p>
