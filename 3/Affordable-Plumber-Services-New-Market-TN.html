<p>Viking SupplyNet's substantial inventory of backflow valves and associated devices consists of leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water supply respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and become breakable. This results in micro-fractures and decreases the standard structural integrity of the system. The system becomes weak and might stop working without warning, triggering damage to the building structure and personal property. Inappropriate installation is likewise a common cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly impossible to identify.</p>
