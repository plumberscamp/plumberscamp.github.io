<p>Aside from these 2 important parts, there are a myriad of small, possibly less crucial things that can break or weaken. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode much more rapidly. Consistent gross smells originating from the toilet can indicate you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting correctly, you might need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. Tank lids can break and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed if mishandled. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by pointing out all the important things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part needs to be in great shape for it to function at its best.</p>
<p>Commercial toilets and urinals are a few of the most important functions of a service.

A clogged toilet can offer a bad experience for your consumers.</p>
