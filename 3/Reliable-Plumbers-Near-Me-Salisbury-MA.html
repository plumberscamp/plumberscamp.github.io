<p>The City of Bellingham requires a backflow preventer on any cross-connection or prospective cross-connection. The backflow preventer may be needed on the water service line, within the structure, or in both locations.

Assemblies not currently listed need to have been listed at the time of the original installation.</p>

A toilet's tank is made up of several little moving parts, such as flapper valves and fill valves, that need to be changed or repaired due to their frequent usage. When these parts wear, they lead to small leakages that are tough to see with the naked eye. This is why it is necessary to call a plumber as quickly as you think you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not just does a leaking toilet drainage, it can likewise lead to flooding and water damage.</p>
