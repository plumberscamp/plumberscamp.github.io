<p>The next requirements to examine is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is essential that the repair professional understands the correct installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly should be set up in the installation orientation for which it was approved.
