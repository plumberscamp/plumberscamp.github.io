<p>Your kitchen sink is an important part of your home, that makes its plumbing's efficient functioning a requirement more than a need. Once the test results show the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated during the repair procedure.

As soon as the system is pressurized, air needs to be gotten rid of from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system must be inspected to make sure no valves were accidentally left open or did not close properly. When the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are totally open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has been gone back to service.</p>
