A clogged sewer pipe might leave you ripe for a drain-cleaning rip-off.</p>

<p>The Inspections Division of the Preparation and Advancement Services Department is a City-County agency accountable for reviewing and checking building and zoning associated activities throughout Forsyth County, with the exception of Kernersville town limits.

<p>Home water softeners, also called ion exchange systems, are home appliances that get rid of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. As soon as the resin beads become filled with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium solution eliminates the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After passing through the beads, the resulting chloride service ends up being a waste stream that decreases the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
