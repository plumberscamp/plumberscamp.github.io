<p>Then connect the waste pipe (and dishwasher hose, if suitable). If your system is outlet-ready-- pay attention to this part-- ensure your disposal switch remains in the off" position prior to you plug the new unit in. While it's unlikely that having a disposal launch while your head is pushed versus it will cause decapitation, it might scare a number of years off your life. Not that I would know from experience.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was great. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the previous. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was quite reasonable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super pleased with their service.</p>
