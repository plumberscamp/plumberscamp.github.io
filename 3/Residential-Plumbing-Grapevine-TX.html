<p>As the water treatment industry has grown in the U.S., the concept of water softening has actually typically been misunderstood as a purifying, cleaning or conditioning process. This is due mainly to overstated marketing and, in part, to consumer misunderstandings about water treatment. However the reality is that water softening simply removes solidity minerals and gets rid of problems that are a problem and not a risk to human health. The choice "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of personal choice not necessity. However, water softening does have benefits, and disadvantages, that make this decision a significant one.</p>
