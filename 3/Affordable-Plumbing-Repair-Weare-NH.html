<p>Before the repair professional begins the repair procedure, he must make sure he has actually examined the workspace around the backflow prevention assembly in order to identify any limiting conditions. Correct safety precautions need to be followed for proper entry if the area is considered a restricted area. A safe and correct work environment may entail the placement of safety barriers or entry limitations around the workspace so the repair service technician or the general public around your work area are not harmed.
