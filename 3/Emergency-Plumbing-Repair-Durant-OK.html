<p>When sewer line breaks, it typically causes the yard above it to become soggy.

Plumbers describe a sewer line break as a plumbing emergency. Hopefully, your Evanston plumber's contact number is on your speed dial.</p>
<p>Improvement plumbers typically charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Once again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts. But increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their bids are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily spend much more. With this approach, you know the turnkey cost entering into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's obligation, not yours.</p>
