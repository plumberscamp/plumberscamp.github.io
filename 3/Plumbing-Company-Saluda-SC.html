The repair may be as easy as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces data on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to understand what the field test information implies for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester translates the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
