<p>The Plumbing and Gas Piping Program IVR system is now accepting inspection demands. CenterPoint Energy's House Service Plus uses you an optional Pipe Protection Plan for just $3.95 a month. It covers interior, readily accessible, natural gas pipes ranging from the gas meter to your natural gas appliances. Auto-reverse setting: Some waste disposal unit come with this setting, which reverses the instructions the blades spin to clear waste. This secures the blades so they don't wear out as fast.</p>
<p>The normal service is to have the malfunctioning pipes changed when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping is available in. This is an option to consider if you reside in an older house - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for home plumbing for numerous years, however steel eventually experiences rust and does not have the durability these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
