For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away a lot more rapidly. Continuous gross smells originating from the toilet can indicate you need a new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting effectively, you might need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and trigger a leak. Tank covers can crack and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed if mishandled. While this will not affect the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by discussing all the things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part needs to be in great shape for it to work at its best.</p>
