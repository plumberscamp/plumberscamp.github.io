<p>Also called a garbage disposer, a garbage disposal comes in 2 fundamental types - continuous feed, which generally has a wall-mounted switch so the unit keeps running as you drop more waste in; and batch feed, which requires a food cover remain in place to operate the system. Constant feed is common and the most convenient to utilize; a batch feed model is safer but can be slower to utilize on large quantities of food waste due to the fact that you need to process it in batches. An Ohio plumbing supply company offers an introduction of garbage disposal types and designs.</p>

A waste disposal unit works by shredding the waste into small pieces that are capable of traveling through the sewage pipes without impeding water circulation. By installing a waste disposal unit you are assisting the environment by saving the quantity of garbage that gets sent out to landfills and other disposing areas.
