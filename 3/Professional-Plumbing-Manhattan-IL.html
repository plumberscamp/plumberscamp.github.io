<p>Backpressure may take place when the potable supply piping is linked to a system or fixture which exceeds the operating pressure of the supply piping.

Non-potable and potable water or liquids can be required into the potable supply system if these connections are not effectively safeguarded.</p>

He noted that there are specific impurities that citizens are handling and an RO can help ease those issues. Due to being largely farming in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some house owners are setting up ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are a product of agricultural waste. Rinckey noted that these systems remove around 94 percent of nitrates. Arsenic also naturally takes place in some soils which too can be remedied with the right RO system.</p>
