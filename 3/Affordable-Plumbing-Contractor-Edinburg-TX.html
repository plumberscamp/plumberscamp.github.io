<p>Reverse osmosis uses an applied pressure gradient throughout a semi permeable membrane to get rid of osmotic pressure and remove water molecules from the solution with firmness ions. The membrane has pores big enough to confess water molecules for passage; firmness ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft supply of water is devoid of hardness ions without any other ions being added. Membranes are a type of water filter needing routine cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
<p>In some cases a clog can be caused due to accumulation and grease within the system. Snaking the drain won't fix the problem if this is the case.
