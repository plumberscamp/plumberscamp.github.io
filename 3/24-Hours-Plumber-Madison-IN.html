For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust much more quickly. Continuous gross smells coming from the toilet can indicate you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain.
