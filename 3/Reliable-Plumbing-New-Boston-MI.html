<p>Note: Hard water stops your washing cleaning agent from working successfully since tough water ions can bond with cleaning agent particles to deactivate them. You, therefore, have to use a growing number of detergent to achieve the same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt solution. Hard minerals captured in the resin (or zeolite) are released and the media gets replenished with salt ions. The water softener is also cleaned and disinfected throughout regrowth. Finally, water consisting of the tough minerals and other waste gets eliminated of the system.</p>
