This includes glass, plastic, metals (yes, flatware), paper, anything combustible, bleach, drain cleaners, and toys.</p>

The last thing is to wire up the brand-new disposal, making sure to connect wires accurately, and the base covered to protect the electrical wiring from any water getting in.</p>
