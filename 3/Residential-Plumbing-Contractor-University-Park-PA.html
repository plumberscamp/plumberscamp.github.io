<p>Echologics has a long history of developing acclaimed acoustic innovations for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a camera through the household sewer pipes (usually from the house to its connection to the public sewer system) can be utilized to examine the type and condition of underground pipes, and to identify problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, clogs, corrosion or collapsed pipes. Homeowners might have a video inspection done to find the reason for regular sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when selling or purchasing an older home.</p>
<p>About 66,100 openings for plumbers, pipefitters, and steamfitters are predicted each year, on average, over the years. Backflow prevention devices protect our drinking water from contamination.

<p>A camera inspection takes the uncertainty out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it avoids the need to collect your lawn. During a video camera inspection, a sewer and drain technician runs a video cable down sewer branch lines that lead from bath tubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Utilizing the images caught by the camera, we can pinpoint any sewer and drain line problems, such as blockages, tree root intrusion, misaligned joints, fractures, and other damage.</p>
<p>Deluge systems are designed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems typically are set up in areas where the possibility of an extreme fire condition is likely, such as airplane hangars. Water to the system is held back by the deluge valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then permits water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
