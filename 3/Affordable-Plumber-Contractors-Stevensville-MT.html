<p>Improvement plumbers normally charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Once again, this does not include the cost of parts. However a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily spend far more. With this technique, you know the turnkey cost going into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's duty, not yours.</p>
