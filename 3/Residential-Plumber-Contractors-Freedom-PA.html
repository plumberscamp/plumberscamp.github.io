<p>Aside from these 2 crucial components, there are a myriad of little, perhaps less important things that can break or weaken. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away far more rapidly. Continuous gross smells coming from the toilet can suggest you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. You may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting appropriately. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. If mishandled, tank covers can break and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by pointing out all the important things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part needs to be in good shape for it to work at its best.</p>
