<p>Our Water Softeners Are Remarkably Designed To Work. A lot of kitchen sink obstructions are due to heavy grease buildup and food particles.

<p>While city water does get treated, it is provided for purposes of getting rid of bacterial issues and making the water drinkable.

<p>Plainly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange site. When all the sodium exchange websites are changed with hardness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regeneration. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to use when backwashing is complete. Some water softeners will immediately change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
