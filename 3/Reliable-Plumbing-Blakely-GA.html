<p>Backflow indicates the unwanted reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable supply of water; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from happening. Points at which a safe and clean water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they need to be thoroughly developed and installed to prevent backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
