<p>The next criteria to examine is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is important that the repair professional knows the right installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to make sure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly must be installed in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. The majority of backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, however it is necessary that the assembly just be installed if it is approved for that orientation.

If a fire takes place, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then allows water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>

The need upstream might trigger a reversal in circulation.</p>
