Anytime you smell sewage in your garden, basement or throughout your home, call a plumber. It indicates your sewer system requires work right away-- the smell is not typical.</p>
<p>A. Generally wax doesn't "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undiscovered issue. Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>

A clogged sewer line can cause a raw sewage backup out of your drains, which can cause significant problems and damage-- specifically common in older homes. Utilizing a sewer camera to examine the weak locations or clog, our extremely trained specialists can rapidly locate the source of the issue keeping your sewer line from doing its job-- effectively transporting wastewater to your septic system or community system.</p>
