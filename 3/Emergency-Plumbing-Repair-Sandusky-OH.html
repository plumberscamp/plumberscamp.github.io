<p>Organic debris, such as food, grease, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the reason for clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's cable television, snake or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of buildup.

<p>Deluge systems are created so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems generally are installed in areas where the possibility of a serious fire condition is likely, such as airplane hangars. Water to the system is kept back by the deluge valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then allows water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
