<p>Button Plumbing was great. They changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was quite affordable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was very happy with their service.</p>

Such connections take place naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they need to be thoroughly developed and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
