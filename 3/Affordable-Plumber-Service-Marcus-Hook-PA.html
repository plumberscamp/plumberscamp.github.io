Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when negative or lower pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity.

A common type of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
