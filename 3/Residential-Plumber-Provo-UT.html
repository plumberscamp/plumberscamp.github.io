<p>Central Ohio Gas Line Services LLC specializes in the installation and repair of residential and commercial gas and lp gas lines, water service lines, gas line troubleshooting and consultation services. If your commercial property currently has a backflow preventer, you're responsible for having it evaluated yearly by a third-party Backflow Tester from our Authorized Tester List We will alert you by mail when it's time for your backflow test.</p>
<p>Sometimes, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as basic as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces data on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to understand what the field test data means for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester analyzes the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
