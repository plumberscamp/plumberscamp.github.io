<p>The function of the Plumbing Inspection Program is to make sure that all plumbing installed during building of a new or renovated structure is installed by well-informed craftsmen in accordance with applicable codes. Wastewater is Flooding Your Sink - A flooding sink is the stock-image for clogged drains. When your sink is filling with water after you wash your hands, clean the meals, or pour flat soda in your sink, you generally know your drain is clogged and requires cleaning.

Obstructions in a component can cause damaging damage to your draining system the longer they continue.</p>
