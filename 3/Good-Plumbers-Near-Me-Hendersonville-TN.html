A totally different disposal, or for installing your first disposal, the sink port needs to be puttied into location. A safe seal is a must. Once connected at the sink drain, the dishwasher port is connected. The last thing is to wire up the brand-new disposal, making sure to connect wires properly, and the base covered to protect the circuitry from any water getting in.</p>
