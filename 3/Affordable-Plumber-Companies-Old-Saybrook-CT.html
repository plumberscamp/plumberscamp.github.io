<h3>How Preemptive Drain Cleaning Can Benefit A Homeowner in Old Saybrook CT 06475</h3>
<p>It can take numerous weeks for backflow preventer installation and compliance to be finished. First, plans for each device to be set up need to be drawn up by a RA or PE, and an application for approval sent to the DEP, which might take up to three weeks or more to process and approve. Turned down plans need to be modified and resubmitted to the DEP approval queue, which can add another several weeks to the timeline.</p>
<p>When used in fighting a fire, fire department connections can be an issue. Firemen by and large are not concerned with backflow prevention problems.
