At the same time, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom manage (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>

<p>If you have actually constantly lived in an area with difficult water, you might not understand just how much it affects you-- however if you've just recently moved from an area with soft water, you're likely all too knowledgeable about the dry, irritated skin and frizzy, dull hair that can result from tough water. Difficult water hinders the lathering of soaps and hair shampoos, causing you to use more. Hard water also makes it more difficult to wash soap off your body, or shampoo out of your hair, which can lead to dandruff and itchiness of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely discover that hard water causes your skin to flake, itch, and redden frequently.</p>
