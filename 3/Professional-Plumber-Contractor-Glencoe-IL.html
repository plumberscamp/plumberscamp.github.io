For an outdoor gas light or device whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can trigger an obstruction or can trigger rust that obstructs the line. Just 4" of water pressure can be enough to block a natural gas line. Noise-- With time sediment can develop in the bottom of your tank.
