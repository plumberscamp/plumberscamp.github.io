<h3>Plumber Installation & Repair Service Dunlap IL</h3>
<p>These guys were incredible! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem on and off for several years now. It was installed 7 years back, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company since they had terrific evaluations and a fair rate, and despite the fact that the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a big, disgusting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a fantastic job tidying up after it also.</p>
