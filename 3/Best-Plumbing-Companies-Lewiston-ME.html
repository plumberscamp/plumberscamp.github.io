<p>The salt water tank help the water softening system in regeneration. It is a shorter tank that sits adjacent to the mineral tank. The salt water tank holds a highly concentrated solution of salt (or in some cases potassium) to restore the resin beads' positive charge. Salt is by hand added to the salt water tank in the form of blocks or pellets. These dissolve in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capability of the resin is reducing, the heavy brine option is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. The water passing through the unit will no longer be softened if the brine tank runs out of salt.</p>
