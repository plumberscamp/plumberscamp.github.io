<p>Water solidity is the quantity of dissolved calcium and magnesium in the water-- difficult water is high in both calcium and magnesium.

Which's where the term solidity" came from ... it's tough to clean in.</p>

<p>Deluge systems are designed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems normally are installed in areas where the possibility of an extreme fire condition is likely, such as aircraft garages. Water to the system is held back by the deluge valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then allows water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
