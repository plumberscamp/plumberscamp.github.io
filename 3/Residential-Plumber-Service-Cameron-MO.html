<p>Your sewer line carries wastewater away from the sinks, toilets, and showers of your home. A damaged gas line is a really serious issue, and often a problem will arise at the most bothersome times.

If your unit is outlet-ready-- focus on this part-- make certain your disposal switch is in the off" position before you plug the brand-new system in.
