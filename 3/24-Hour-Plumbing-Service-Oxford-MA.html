<h3>Water Leak Repair in Oxford Massachusetts</h2>
<p>Water softening uses a procedure called "ion exchange" to get rid of liquified difficult water minerals such as calcium, manganese, iron and magnesium. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular reaction is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto sodium, and as the tough water streams through the resin, the sodium is swapped for the hard water minerals. The difficult water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace amount of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>
