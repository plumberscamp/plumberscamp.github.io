Water pressure might stop working or be lowered when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high need on the water supply (for example, when a number of fire hydrants are opened). Lowered pressure in the pipe may enable polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
