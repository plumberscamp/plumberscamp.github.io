<p>If you are aiming to replace an existing underground sewer pipe that has actually started to leak, first consider your choices. A full sewer pipe replacement may not be essential. Frequently, relining your existing pipes is a much better choice. If your sewer lines are underneath trees, near extensive landscaping, pathways, driveways or other semi-permanent features, total sewer excavation can cause a lot of civilian casualties (and expense) to the surrounding area.</p>
<p>The pipe-bursting technique is utilized on pipes that are badly harmed, for changing a whole pipe system, or for repairing larger sections of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to begin repair, that includes two 4 foot square gain access to pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers start by positioning a "bursting head" at the access point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is used to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its way through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and attracting a new smooth pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic product that will be impervious to root intrusion for up to 100 years.</p>
