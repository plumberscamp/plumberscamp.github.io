<p>Figuring out if you need a water softener is a personal preference. Water softener systems work by getting rid of solidity minerals and replacing them with sodium ions. Water conditioners are gadgets that help avoid the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to inhibit the scale from building up by neutralizing the solidity itself. Due to the reality that water conditioners use a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are often thought about a greener option in locations where it is forbidden to utilize salt. Water conditioners do not effectively get rid of solidity from the water supply, however, as the only method to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
