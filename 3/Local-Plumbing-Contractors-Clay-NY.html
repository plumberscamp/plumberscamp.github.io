<p>Your waste disposal unit guarantees that your sink and plumbing fixtures don't get clogged. Contrary to some individuals's understanding, garbage disposals do not include blades.

When the disposal is switched on the disks quickly spin, and these bolts require food and particles to grind against a fixed grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action effectively pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without obstructing.</p>
