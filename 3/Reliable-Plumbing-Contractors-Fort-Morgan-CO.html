<p>Many homeowners think their utility companies or house owners insurance is responsible for emergency repairs to the water, sewer, plumbing, electrical, heating and cooling systems, however the reality is that in a lot of cases you, the property owner, are accountable. A lot of standard homeowners insurance coverage and local utility companies or municipalities do not cover repairs to or replacement of the significant systems around your house.</p>
<p>Finding the place or source of an issue is done through visual inspection of sewer pipes, color testing, and closed circuit video of the sewer main. By inspecting the inside of sewage systems, crews can determine the source of the issue, nature of the clog, and condition of the pipe If you live in Ames, IA, plumbing installation from Golden Rule Plumbing, Heating & Cooling can take care of a full repiping quickly and effectively.</p>

The best strainers have either a spin-lock or a twist-and-drop style stopper. The spin-lock stopper doesn't have any parts that can wear, however screwing it in and out can be irritating. The twist-and-drop style is a lot easier to use but needs occasional -ring replacement.</p>
