<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water system pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on.
