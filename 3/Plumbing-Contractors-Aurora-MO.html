The two types of pipes that we prefer to utilize for repiping are copper and PEX. These are 2 extremely different products, however they both have unbelievable durability and durability.</p>
<p>As part of EBMUD's program, the District's backflow inspectors are required to conduct site inspections to identify if a backflow prevention device is needed as a result of a real or possible  cross-connection danger on a consumer's plumbing system. Plumbing and gas piping inspections located on Vashon Island are only performed on Wednesdays.
