<p>The best source for this type of plumber is a basic contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work before it's concealed; you do not get that chance. In addition, your contractor knows the dead giveaways of quality work that you may miss, like clean solder joints, crisp 90-degree angles at joints and clean, correctly sized holes in studs, joists, and floorings. Finally, a quality contractor will not threat working with a shoddy plumber. A basic mistake-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can easily ravage $10,000 worth of walls or wood floors and make complex the task with insurance claims, lost time, and claims. With a lot riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick with only the very best.</p>
