<p>Brine Valve - Controls water flow in and out of salt tank. Functions automatic shut-off to prevent overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is almost certainly from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water material of LP or gas is extremely low. Rainwater which has not infiltrated the earth is an extremely pure kind of water. When water evaporates it leaves dissolved solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. Therefore when vaporized water eventually falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
