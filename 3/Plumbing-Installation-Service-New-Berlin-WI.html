<p>The U-shaped pipe underneath bathroom and kitchen sinks is something that people expect to see but seldom stop to think about. The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you turn the switch, but it does not grind up food, this indicates the flywheel is stuck. Try releasing the jam by placing a hex wrench of the appropriate size into the hole on the bottom of the garbage disposal. Alternately, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom manage (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
