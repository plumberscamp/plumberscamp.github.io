Recent Review: Carlos and Lopez were fantastic. My 90 year old Father's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos got to 8am the next day to repair. Because of the age of the home and place of the pipe, it was a hard task. They worked for almost 12 hours into darkness to make sure the system was working prior to they left. I am really grateful for their hard work and professionalism.</p>
<p>The trick to avoiding a clogged waste disposal unit is small amounts. As long as the food waste is sent through the disposal at an affordable quantity, there ought to be no concern in getting the majority of the waste through. There are a couple of food items you need to most likely not put into the garbage disposal though. Those products are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another suggestion to stop clogging is to watch out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will harden when they cool so it is best to wash pots and pans that have those liquids under warm water and to continue to let the water run for a number of seconds after you are finished cleaning to ensure the drain is clear.</p>
