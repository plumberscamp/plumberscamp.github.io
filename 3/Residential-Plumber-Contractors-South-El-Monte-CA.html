<p>The source or place of a sewer problem determines who spends for repair. The City is accountable for the general public right of way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another.

Easements (generally 10 feet broad) where main sewage systems traverse personal property are an exception to this rule.</p>
<p>Current Review: A journeyman plumber and his assistant arrived during the designated time period. They unplugged the sinks, tidied up and recommended a tool to be utilized in the future. How do you understand if it's time to require sewer line repair or replacement? Look out for numerous clogged drains in your house, overflowing or supported toilets, or water stains on your walls and foundation.</p>
