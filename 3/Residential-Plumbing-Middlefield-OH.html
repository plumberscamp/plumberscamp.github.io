<h3>The Many Services Provided By Residential Plumbers Middlefield OH</h3>
<p>These people were fantastic! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem on and off for many years now. It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I picked this company due to the fact that they had excellent evaluations and a reasonable rate, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a huge, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a great job cleaning up after it also.</p>
<p>The cost to replace pipes under the house is simply the cost to install a brand-new plumbing system which can vary from $2,000 to $15,000 or more. You can install new copper pipes for $3 to $8 per direct foot, or $0.40 to $0.50 per linear foot for PEX hose. Pipes do run under houses, sometimes in concrete.
