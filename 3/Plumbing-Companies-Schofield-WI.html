<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a few things you can do to keep your drains clear. Avoid putting grease or oil down the drains. Use an option of baking soda and vinegar periodically to keep your drains and garbage disposal clean. You can utilize a natural drain cleaner month-to-month to keep your drains clear. We advise natural products, such as Bio-Clean, since they work much better than products consisting of extreme chemicals and won't trigger damage to your drains or fixtures.</p>
<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, effective, and an excellent guy. He told me exactly what to anticipate (cost, time, procedure) up front and delivered as promised. I will definitely use Clog Dawg once again. Setting up a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with an average per hour rate of $25 to $70. These prices are in addition to the cost of the disposal system. If your plumber has a minimum callout charge that is higher than the labor cost for the work, the overall you pay might be higher.</p>
