<p>When a natural gas line is burst, it instantly ends up being a serious safety hazard. Without being repaired as quickly as possible, it could trigger a fair bit of damage if the gas inside ends up being ignited.

<p>Improvement plumbers typically charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Once again, this doesn't include the cost of parts. However a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the component," and their quotes are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily invest a lot more. With this method, you know the turnkey cost going into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's obligation, not yours.</p>

Wages can differ depending upon the agreement, company, location and collective arrangements (if relevant), in addition to national and local financial conditions. Overtime is not consisted of.</p>
