<p>As the water treatment market has grown in the U.S., the principle of water softening has typically been misconstrued as a purifying, cleaning or conditioning procedure. This is due mostly to overstated advertising and, in part, to customer mistaken beliefs about water treatment. However the reality is that water softening merely gets rid of hardness minerals and gets rid of problems that are an annoyance and not a risk to human health. The decision "to soften or not to soften" refers personal preference not necessity. Nevertheless, water softening does have benefits, and disadvantages, that make this choice a significant one.</p>
<p>The cost to repipe a home with PEX tubing is $0.40 to $0.50 per direct foot depending upon the size of your home and the extent of replumbing you're doing.
