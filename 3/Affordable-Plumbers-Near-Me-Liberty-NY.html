<p>When sewer line breaks, it often causes the lawn above it to end up being soaked. You may smell the disgusting smell of sewage before you feel the squish of your yard under your feet (hopefully shoed feet!). A sinkhole can form, making it required to cordon off that portion of your yard. Due to the fact that the swampiness will bring in unwanted creatures, the situation is fraught with problems. Plumbers describe a sewer line break as a plumbing emergency. Ideally, your Evanston plumber's phone number is on your speed dial.</p>
<p>The Delaware Division of Public Health Plumbing Permit and Inspection Program has offices in Kent and Sussex Counties.
