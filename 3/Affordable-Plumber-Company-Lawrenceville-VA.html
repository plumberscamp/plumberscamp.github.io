When the control valve signs up the softening capacity of the resin is reducing, the heavy salt water option is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank.

TLC can utilize a camera to see down into the drain line and locate the clog or break in the line. All TLC's Drain Cleaning Professionals are equipped with this type of camera to determine and repair the drain problem.
