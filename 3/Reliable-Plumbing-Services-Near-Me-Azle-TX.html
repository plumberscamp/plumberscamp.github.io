<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the houses in our area were developed before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water became basic. Older houses were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that comes in contact with water and oxygen will rust. This rust, or rust, triggers the iron to swell up and become flaky. In order to prevent the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and produces a waterproof membrane to safeguard the iron from rusting.</p>
