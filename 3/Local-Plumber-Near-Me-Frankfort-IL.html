<h3>Emergency Plumbing Service Frankfort IL</h3>
<p>We are good at what we do and we appreciate our clients! Your perspective is very much considered in every job kcb Plumbing contractors carries out. Backflow is the reversal of the flow of water in the plumbing system. When the pressure in the water main or a home's plumbing system modifications, it can happen. If your toilet is overflowing, then you have a clog in the drain line someplace. The primary step would be to clear the clog which you may need a professional plumber for.</p>
<p>At any time the pressure on the home (downstream) side surpasses the pressure on the city side, the two redundant check valves close-- avoiding any backflow. However, while DCV systems are considered safe for most fire defense systems, they do have a defect: if both valves stop working or particles in the water line avoids them from closing totally, backflow can occur.</p>
