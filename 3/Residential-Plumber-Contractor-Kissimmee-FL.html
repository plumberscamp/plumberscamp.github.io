He noted that there are specific pollutants that citizens are dealing with and an RO can help reduce those problems. Due to being largely farming in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some homeowners are installing ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are a product of farming waste. Rinckey kept in mind that these systems eliminate around 94 percent of nitrates. Arsenic also naturally occurs in some soils and that too can be remedied with the best RO system.</p>

A backflow preventer not only safeguards drinking water in specific residences, it likewise avoids wastewater in private homes from flowing back out and infecting the public water supply.</p>
