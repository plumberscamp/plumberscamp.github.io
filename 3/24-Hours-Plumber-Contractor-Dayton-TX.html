<p>A. Generally wax does not "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" unnoticed problem. Attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>We have an inspection program to identify water sources and situations that require backflow prevention gadgets. For home, it is important for owners to signal the District if any changes are made, such as digging a brand-new well. For commercial home, the District reviews using each new renter. The correction should be made before water service is permitted if the present backflow is not up to District code. Cost for the device is covered by either the residential or commercial property or the tenant owner.</p>

That's why you need to never ever delay a repair. A professional plumber will be able to properly find the source of the leak and recommend the best service.
