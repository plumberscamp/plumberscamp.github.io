<p>The pipe-bursting technique is used on pipes that are severely damaged, for changing a whole pipe system, or for fixing larger areas of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to start repair, that includes two four foot square gain access to pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers start by positioning a "bursting head" at the access point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is used to drag the head through the pipe.

<p>There's a good chance you have galvanized pipes if you have an older house. And if your house was integrated in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are most likely nearing completion of their life-span. As galvanized pipes age, they start to rust. This rust can cause a buildup of lead, which can have lots of unfavorable effects on your health. Corroded pipes also result in poor water quality and low water pressure.</p>

Hard minerals captured in the resin (or zeolite) are released and the media gets renewed with salt ions. The water softener is also cleaned and decontaminated during regrowth. Finally, water containing the difficult minerals and other waste gets eliminated of the system.</p>
