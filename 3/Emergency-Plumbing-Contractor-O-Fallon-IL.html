<p>Sewer lines have one vital role: carry wastewater out of a home or building. Most folks replace their hot water heater due to bad efficiency, complete failure or as a preventive measure. If your water heater is more than 10 years old, it's time to think about changing it with a more effective design. Water on the floor can mean used parts.
