<p>In some homes, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to method when looking for a practical solution, particularly when simple plunging doesn't appear to work. However, there are many disadvantages to using these harmful items - not least of which is that they generally include compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering a clog, which can range from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, little things, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life.
