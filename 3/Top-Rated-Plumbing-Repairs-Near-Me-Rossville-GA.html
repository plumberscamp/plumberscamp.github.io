Many fire sprinkler heads, except sprinkler heads on a deluge system are kept closed by a heat-sensitive operating system. Generally, this operating system is either a fusible link or a glass bulb.  Regardless of the operating system, just the sprinklers that are exposed to heat will open during a fire.</p>
