<h3>Licensed Plumbing & HVAC Company In Glendale CA</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in safe and clean supply of water pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being utilized surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at as much as 3,500 PSI. This enables the sewer lines to be cleaned quickly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, releasing from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to remove debris such as tough water scale, grease, silt, and sand deposits.</p>
