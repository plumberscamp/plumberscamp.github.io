<p>Changing your sink is a detailed process. Measure, cut, and link the pipes. Before connecting any pipes to your water softener, measure and cut your pipes to fit. If you are utilizing copper pipes, solder on any nipples and fittings before linking the unit to the bypass valve to prevent melting the plastic. Seal all threads with plumber's tape.

Costing less than a complete repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future.
