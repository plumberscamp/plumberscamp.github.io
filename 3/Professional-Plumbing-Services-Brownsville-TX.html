<p>Salt Water Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Functions automated shut-off to prevent overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is likely from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water material of LP or gas is extremely low. Rainwater which has actually not filtered through the earth is a remarkably pure type of water. When water vaporizes it leaves dissolved solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions.

These chemicals are simple to use and economical, but they damage your pipes and their effects are only short-term.
