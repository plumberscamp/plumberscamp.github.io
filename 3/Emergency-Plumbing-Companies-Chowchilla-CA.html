<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in safe and clean supply of water pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being utilized surpasses the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
