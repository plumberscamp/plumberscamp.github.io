<p>Sewer linings can help to repair split pipes without needing to entirely replace your sewer lines or destroy the area around them. Because it is a large job that is frequently viewed as an unneeded cost, many property owners avoid repiping their homes. Why repipe your home when repairing it is possible? Well, the truth is that repiping is more effective and economical in a lot of cases.

Depending on the length of the waste arm, you may be able to cut off its elbow and use the rest as a straight discharge tube.</p>
