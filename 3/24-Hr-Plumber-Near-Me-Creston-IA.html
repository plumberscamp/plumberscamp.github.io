<p>An overall repipe of a home's water system, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most intricate and expensive plumbing job, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on whole home repiping. Current Evaluation: Carlos and Lopez were amazing. My 90 year old Daddy's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos came to 8am the next day to repair. Because of the age of the house and place of the pipe, it was a challenging job. They worked for nearly 12 hours into darkness to ensure the system was working before they left. I am really grateful for their hard work and professionalism.</p>

<p>Sometimes, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces data on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to know what the field test information means for that specific assembly.  When an experienced tester translates the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
