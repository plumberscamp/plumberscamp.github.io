A water heater that is not set up properly can lead to water damage, scalding temperature levels, or even a fire. That's why installation is best delegated professional plumbers who understand the ins and outs of your plumbing system.</p>
<p>Except for domestic pump and pump and watering systems, certification is not required to install plumbing systems beyond a building (e.g., water lines connected directly to local water pipe, sewer line connections, and so on).
