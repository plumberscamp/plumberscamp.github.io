<p>The most effective method to address difficult water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When difficult water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and changed with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>If your sewer line is clogged or you think it of being damaged, a digital camera inspection of the pipe is among the very best tools for identifying both the cause of the issue, and the area of the issue.
