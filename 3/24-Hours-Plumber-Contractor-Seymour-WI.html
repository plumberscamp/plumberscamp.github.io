<p>The economics of brand-new high-efficiency water softeners. The specialist switched off the water supply and loosened the bolts that were holding the toilet to the floor. He was then able to remove the pipe to clear the clog and reattach the pipe to the toilet fixture. The customer assisted our specialist in moving the toilet back into its proper location, and the service technician tightened up the bolts prior to restoring the water system and making sure that the toilet was effectively flushing.</p>
