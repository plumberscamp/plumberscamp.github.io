<p>Sewer linings can assist to repair split pipes without having to totally replace your sewer lines or damage the area around them. Daily use ought to not trigger a water softener to leak. Leakages can also take place if you bump into the softener and scramble it, pulling the fitting apart. To avoid this from happening, install the unit in a safe and stable  place. If you live in an earthquake-prone area of the country, secure the softener so that if the structure begins moving, the softener doesn't tip over and remove the plumbing. If your water softener is leaking during regrowth, you need to wait until after the cycle is completed and then inspected the system for cracks or broken fittings. You ought to also inspect to make sure your drain line is never blocked up with debris. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener during regeneration and flood your basement or garage.</p>
