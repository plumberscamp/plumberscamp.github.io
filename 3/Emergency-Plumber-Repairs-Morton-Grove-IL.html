<p>Loose flanges are generally the result of wood rot. The flange screws merely won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best option depends upon the level of the rot.

Before you install this sort of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
