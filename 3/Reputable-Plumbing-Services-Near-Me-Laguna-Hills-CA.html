<p>Loose flanges are typically the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws simply won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best option depends upon the level of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Before you install this sort of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>
