Even little leaks can gradually moisten walls and floors until they become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other irritants. Old galvanized iron pipes might end up being corroded and add rust to the water supply. Gurgling noise from pipes. A strange, gurgling sound originating from the toilet whenever you flush or from the bathtub drain after you took a bath is never ever a good sign. Opportunities are your sewer line is clogged, and a plunger may not suffice to address this issue. Call a plumber immediately.</p>
<p>This is very important! When you have actually cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet provides to press the waste out of your drain system.
