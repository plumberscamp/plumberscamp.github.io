<p>Viking SupplyNet's substantial stock of backflow valves and related devices consists of leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water supply respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and become fragile. This leads to micro-fractures and reduces the standard structural stability of the system. The system becomes weak and may stop working without caution, causing damage to the building structure and personal property.
