Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they need to be carefully created and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
