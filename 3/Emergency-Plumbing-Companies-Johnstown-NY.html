<p>Water temperature level problems can be fixed by adjusting the temperature on the hot water heater. Low water pressure from a sink faucet may be caused by a blocked aerator screen. Homeowners can just loosen the aerator screen from the faucet to clean out minerals or other deposits. If the shutoff valves under the sink are not open all the way, water pressure can also be low.</p>
<p>This is an elbow-shaped device bent at a 90 degree angle. There is a valve on the inside of it that prevents water backflow. The system is based upon pressure and should be set up a minimum of 6 inches of where the downstream will be. It can be put on PVC pipes, but is not testable.
