<p>The U-shaped pipe beneath bathroom and kitchen sinks is something that people anticipate to see but rarely stop to think of. The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you turn the switch, but it doesn't grind up food, this suggests the flywheel is stuck. Attempt freeing the jam by placing a hex wrench of the correct size into the hole on the bottom of the garbage disposal. Alternately, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom handle (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
<p>The normal solution is to have the defective pipes replaced when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes.
