<p>The last thing you want is for your garbage disposal to give out if you spend time entertaining visitors and cooking.

Let our plumbing contractors assist you keep your kitchen in top shape.</p>
<p>A. Typically wax doesn't "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undetected issue. Try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Improvement plumbers normally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Once again, this does not include the cost of parts. But increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their bids are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly invest a lot more. With this approach, you understand the turnkey cost going into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
