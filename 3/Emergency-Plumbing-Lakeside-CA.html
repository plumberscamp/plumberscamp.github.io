<p>While city water does get dealt with, it is done for functions of getting rid of bacterial problems and making the water drinkable. These are certainly top priorities for a town and its homeowners but hard water can adversely affect faucets and home appliances in a house. With the high calcium material of local water, it can trigger a dishwasher or water heater to breakdown.</p>

<p>When the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming potable water supply, backpressure backflow in a building results. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when negative or decreased pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common kind of backflow preventer is the decreased pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
