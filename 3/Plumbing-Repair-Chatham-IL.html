Here are 3 reasons to avoid pouring these severe chemicals down your drain.</p>
<p>Organic particles, such as hair, food, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the cause of clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's drain, snake or cable auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup.

If you use the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it deserves it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
