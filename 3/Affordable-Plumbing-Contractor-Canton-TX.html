<p>As soon as the hardware parts have been cleaned and inspected and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some parts might have extremely tight tolerances that need to be preserved. An essential thing to determine on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the part. The guide is an extremely vital part of the design of each element. If the component is not repaired correctly, the guide could limit the movement (instead of direct or stable) of the part, which could trigger the element to not work to its capabilities. Many times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are restricting the travel of the component causing lower test results than what is required.</p>
