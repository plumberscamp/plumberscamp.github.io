<p>The U-shaped pipe below kitchen and bathroom sinks is something that people expect to see but seldom stop to think about. The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you flip the switch, however it does not grind up food, this implies the flywheel is stuck. Try releasing the jam by placing a hex wrench of the proper size into the hole on the bottom of the waste disposal unit. Alternately, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom handle (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
<p>Plumbing licenses and inspection are just required if plumbing fixtures are being installed as part of the project. Repeating repairs - If your toilet is in consistent need of repair, it might be more financial for you to replace the whole unit. Planning and Advancement Services can examine building and construction plans sent by the customer however we can not develop the plans for you. If you need assistance in designing a plan you will need to call a design professional.  All strategies are required to be neat, understandable and well arranged.</p>
