<p>The list of things a food disposer can take in is relatively brief. Crisp or soft foods are great, but hard or stringy foods can be difficulty. Disposers can be stopped in their tracks by celery, eggshells and apple seeds, in addition to the usual kitchen flotsam, including pop-tabs, scouring pads and twist-ties.

Anderson Plumbing, Heating and Air can visit your house, inspect the valves throughout your home, and encourage you of any alternatives or possible repairs that need to be thought about now or in the future. When guests arrive or having to call a plumber, an ounce of prevention can mean the distinction between having a working shower valve in the extra bathroom.</p>
