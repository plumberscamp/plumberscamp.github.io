The study included tests that got rid of difficult soils, in addition to assessing shooting and spotting. Scientists discovered that softened water uses almost 30% less cleaning agent, but cleans along with water at 10 gpg firmness level. That detergent cost savings rises to nearly 70% when comparing soft water with water at a 25 gpg level.</p>
