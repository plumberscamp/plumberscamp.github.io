Merely pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, include some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. You can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that does not work. Much of these cleaners include focused levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be extremely hazardous if it can be found in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs.
