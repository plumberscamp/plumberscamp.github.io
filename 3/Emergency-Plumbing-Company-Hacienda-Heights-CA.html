<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in safe and clean water system pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
<p>Whether a water system is labelled "soft" or "difficult" depends on the presence of two highly soluble minerals, calcium and magnesium.

Nevertheless, when calcium and magnesium permeate water, they buildup on contact surface areas, possibly plug pipes and damage water heaters, and reduce the efficiency of cleaning agents and soaps. At this moment the water is said to be tough.</p>
