<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming drinkable water supply. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage happens when negative or decreased pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common type of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>

<p>In some cases, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as basic as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces information on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test data suggests for that particular assembly.  When a skilled tester translates the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
