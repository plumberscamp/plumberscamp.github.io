<p>The discharge tube consisted of in the disposer kit will be connected to the disposer using the plate, gasket and screws originally meant for the disposer discharge elbow. If your package only includes a waste arm, it is possible - though not recommended - to connect this to the disposer discharge elbow using a slip joint. The consecutive 90 ° turns in such a setup can lead to inappropriate drainage. Depending upon the length of the waste arm, you might be able to cut off its elbow and use the rest as a straight discharge tube.</p>
<p>Organic debris, such as hair, food, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's cable, snake or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's Do It Yourself project. If you use the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leakages - so it's worth it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
