<p>Aside from these two important components, there are a myriad of small, maybe less crucial things that can break or weaken. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust a lot more quickly. Constant gross smells coming from the toilet can suggest you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising correctly, you might need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and trigger a leak. Tank lids can crack and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed if mishandled. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it definitely does not do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by pointing out all the important things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part needs to be in good shape for it to work at its best.</p>
