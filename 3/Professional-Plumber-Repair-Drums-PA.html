<p>The list of things a food disposer can take in is relatively short. Soft or crisp foods are fine, but tough or stringy foods can be difficulty. Disposers can be dropped in their tracks by celery, eggshells and apple seeds, along with the normal kitchen flotsam, consisting of pop-tabs, searching pads and twist-ties. While some older houses might not have backflow preventers, all more recent properties are needed to have them.

Rinckey said that both Belding and Greenville city water measures around 18 gpg, which is considered exceptionally difficult water, leaving telltale signs like spotty glasses and soap residue that is next to difficult to eliminate. With well water, these signs may also be paired with iron stains and sulfur-smells coming from the tap.</p>
