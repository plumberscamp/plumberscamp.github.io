<p>The most effective way to deal with tough water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When hard water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and changed with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>

<p>In the meantime, however, we suggest you first try using non-harsh and non-abrasive white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Just pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, include some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. If that does not work, you can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. A lot of these cleaners contain focused levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be very damaging if it is available in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. If utilizing one of these items, please make sure to take the proper preventative measures.</p>
