The most common washers are often offered in your home centers and hardware stores. Other designs can be tough to find. Eliminate it and take it to the shop to find a match if you choose to hunt for a washer. Plumbers usually replace the whole fill valve rather than hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
<p>A. Generally wax doesn't "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undetected issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
