<p>Water softening uses a process called "ion exchange" to eliminate dissolved tough water minerals such as calcium, iron, manganese and magnesium. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular response is required. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto salt, and as the hard water streams through the resin, the salt is switched for the difficult water minerals. The difficult water minerals are trapped in a trace and the softener quantity of salt drains with the softened water.</p>
<p>As soon as installed, these BPAs go through regular and initial testing and maintenance requirements to validate their continued functional effectiveness. Such testing needs to be carried out by a state licensed Back-flow Prevention Assemble Tester signed up with the City of Austin.

<p>Note: Difficult water stops your washing detergent from working efficiently since difficult water ions can bond with cleaning agent particles to deactivate them. You, therefore, need to utilize more and more cleaning agent to achieve the exact same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt solution. Hard minerals captured in the resin (or zeolite) are launched and the media gets replenished with sodium ions. The water softener is also cleaned up and decontaminated during regrowth. Finally, water including the difficult minerals and other waste gets flushed out of the system.</p>
