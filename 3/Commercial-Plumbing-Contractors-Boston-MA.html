Water conditioners are devices that help prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They utilize a physical media to hinder the scale from developing by reducing the effects of the solidity itself. Due to the fact that water conditioners utilize a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are sometimes considered a greener option in areas where it is forbidden to use salt.

<p>Light Blue = Minimized Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is reduced by the # 1 Check spring (for example, to 90 psi).
