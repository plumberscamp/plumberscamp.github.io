When tree roots start to make their method inside someone's main sewer line, there is capacity for this to cause drain problems. The type of drain pipes currently installed, such as cast iron, plastic, copper or clay, will figure out the extent of the damage that tree roots can trigger to a sewer line.</p>
<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a used flapper is generally the culprit. However not always. Initially, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper.
