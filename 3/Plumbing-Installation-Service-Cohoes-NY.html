AVB's can be plastic or brass and either electric or manual. Unlike other backflow preventers, AVBs are set up on each zone of the watering system, right away after the zone control valve.</p>
<p>In some cases, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as basic as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates data on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test data suggests for that particular assembly.  When an experienced tester interprets the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
