<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water system pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean supply of water pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
