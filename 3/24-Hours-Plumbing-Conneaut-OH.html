<p>In time, like any other appliance in your home, your garbage disposal. might require repairs. A disposal system may clog or start to leak through heavy, or inappropriate, usage.

<p>Some manufacturers claim that the electrical devices they produce can impact the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surface areas. Since these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like conventional water softeners do, one advantage declared for the user is the elimination of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant development promotion have been claimed, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just modify the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of particular systems has actually shown a reduction of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" however rather "water conditioning".</p>
