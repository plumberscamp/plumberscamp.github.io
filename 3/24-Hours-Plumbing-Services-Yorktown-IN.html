The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to ensure there is an air space, if there is no other way to supply one, then we inspect to see that the appropriate BFP device is set up. These BFP's, if testable, are required to be evaluated (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and a minimum of every twelve months thereafter.</p>
