It is a little brass unit that can be straight threaded on to the hose bib.</p>
<p>Each element of the assembly should be tested to determine what needs repair. The field test may not constantly reveal you the seriousness of the failure or whether repair parts beyond the fundamental rubber repair kit are needed.
