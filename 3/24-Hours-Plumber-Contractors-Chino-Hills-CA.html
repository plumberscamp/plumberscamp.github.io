It was set up 7 years back, and it never drained this well. I picked this company because they had fantastic reviews and a fair rate, and even though the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a great job tidying up after it as well.</p>
<p>Food scraps compose as much as 20% of all household waste. If it can quickly and rapidly be disposed of through the sink, this big quantity of trash does not need to go in the garbage can. A garbage disposal works by shredding the waste into tiny pieces that can taking a trip through the sewage pipes without impeding water circulation. By setting up a waste disposal unit you are helping the environment by conserving the quantity of garbage that gets sent out to landfills and other discarding areas. With a garbage disposal the trash is managed through currently existing water infrastructure.</p>
