<p>Another common argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves need to prevent backflow.  The apparent issue with this is that if the backflow takes place at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic manually operated valve must stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if fully closed, has excellent seals, and does not leak.  However most of the automated valves, such as the electric solenoid valves used for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and totally closed.</p>
<p>Plumbing is an important part of your home or business, and its ability to function is essential. If you experience frequent problems with your plumbing, like drains blocking, this could be a sign of a larger problem, like a tree root invasion or a big clog. If the drains clog occasionally but you can generally flush them out, this might be a smaller sized clog like a buildup of grease from the kitchen, or hair and soap scum from the bathroom. Small obstructions can turn into big ones relatively quickly.</p>
