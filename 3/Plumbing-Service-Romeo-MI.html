<p>Replacing your sink is a step-by-step process. Measure, cut, and link the pipes. Prior to connecting any pipes to your water softener, step and cut your pipes to fit.

Water softeners normally utilize sodium (Na+) as the exchange ion. Salt ions are supplied from liquified salt chloride salt, also called salt water. In the ion exchange process, salt ions are used to coat an exchange medium in the softener The exchange medium can be natural zeolites" or artificial resin beads that resemble wet sand.</p>
<p>Template-Assisted Crystallization: Shortened to TAC, this method utilizes resin beads as a catalytic nucleation site where solidity mineral ions are changed into a steady crystalline type that will not hold on to surface areas.
