<p>House water softeners, also called ion exchange units, are devices that get rid of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water.

When the resin beads become full of calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium option gets rid of the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride solution ends up being a waste stream that goes down the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>

<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was quite sensible. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely happy with their service.</p>
