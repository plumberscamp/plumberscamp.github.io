<p>House owners can ask for a plumbing inspection at any time, but it is specifically sensible to organize inspections on an annual basis and when purchasing a new home. Enzyme-Based Drain Cleaners: Like the baking soda and vinegar mix, an enzyme treatment will also keep pipes running smoothly. Enzymes are bacteria that feed upon raw material, such as hair, mold, algae and other common clog-causers. This all-natural service is effective and safe. Contact us today at High 5 Plumbing to acquire our suggested enzyme cleaner, Bioclean.</p>
<p>An electrical inspection supplies inspection services for all commercial and commercial buildings, and validates compliance with the electrical code. The intent of electrical inspection is to ensure compliance with the appropriate electrical code in order to lower personal, and structural electrical risks. Initially call your local energy company then call a plumber if you believe a gas leak. Licensed professional plumbers will spot and repair the gas leak, provide authorizations, and coordinate with the city for final inspections. An utility company will spot if there is a gas leak, but they do not find the source of the leak or repair it.</p>

<p>Changing damaged and old pipes is a financial investment that will pay off. Your home will run more effectively, your month-to-month energy bills will remain low, and you will not need to spend extra money for expensive and unanticipated repairs. Fruit and Drain Flies - Do you notice small flies spending time your sink? This might be a sign of a clogged drain. When sewage, garbage, and waste clog a drain, they attract flies. Both the flies and the clogged drains can pose a risk which is why it is necessary to have a professional clean your drains.</p>
