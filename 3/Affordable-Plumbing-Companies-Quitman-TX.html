<p>Inspections avoid a high portion of plumbing emergency situations. There are some things you can do for your hot water heater to assist it run correctly. It is necessary to ensure there is always two feet of clearance around it. You need to also drain about 25 percent of your tank regularly (a few times each year). This will help get rid of any sediment that has actually settled inside the tank.</p>
<p>Food scraps compose up to 20% of all household waste. If it can easily and rapidly be disposed of through the sink, this large quantity of trash does not need to go in the garbage can.
