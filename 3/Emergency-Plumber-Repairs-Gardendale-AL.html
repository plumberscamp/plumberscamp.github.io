<p>Sewer linings can assist to repair cracked pipes without needing to totally replace your sewer lines or ruin the area around them. Day to day usage should not cause a water softener to leak. Leakages can also take place if you run into the softener and scramble it, pulling the fitting apart. To prevent this from happening, install the unit in a stable and safe location. If you reside in an earthquake-prone area of the nation, secure the softener so that if the foundation starts moving, the softener doesn't fall over and remove the plumbing. If your water softener is leaking throughout regeneration, you should wait until after the cycle is finished and then inspected the system for cracks or broken fittings.

<p>If the problems occurs well outside that 8 to 12 year life-span, a rule of thumb is that you can recapture the cost of the repair.

The closer the device is to that 8 to 12-year limitation, the more uncertain the economics of a repair becomes. The reason is that some other part on the device will go or its tank will leak. And there's no remedy for a leaking tank.</p>
