<p>For plumbing work other that repair or replacement fixtures, a building authorization is usually required before a plumbing permit can be released. Soften just what you need to. Individuals often choose to soften showers, sinks, and laundry hookups. Toilets, hose bibs, basement sinks, and other cold water taps generally do not need to be connected to a softener. In many cases, people choose to soften only the warm water.</p>
<p>If you have an older home, there's a great chance you have galvanized pipes. And if your home was integrated in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are most likely nearing completion of their life expectancy. As galvanized pipes age, they begin to corrode. This deterioration can result in a buildup of lead, which can have lots of unfavorable results on your health. Corroded pipes also lead to bad water quality and low water pressure.</p>
