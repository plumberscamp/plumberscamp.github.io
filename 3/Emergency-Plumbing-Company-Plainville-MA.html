No, we aren't joking, Coca-Cola contains a trace quantity of phosphoric acid. To try this, drain the toilet bowl to listed below where the rust marks are. Then soak some Coke. Wipe with a soft fabric and then more Coke, over and over, etc. Then use Naval Jelly which contains a lot more phosphoric acid (be sure to read the instructions and security cautions first!), if that does not do the technique.

Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium.

After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride solution becomes a waste stream that decreases the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
