The activation of a faucet requiring hot water triggers the heater and water is heated as it flows through a heating coil or heat exchanger. Cooking oil and other greases must never ever be put down the garbage disposal because they can hinder the blades. Lastly, cold water needs to be running when the garbage disposal is on and must continue to run for 30 seconds after the disposal is shut off to make sure that all food particles have been washed through the pipes.</p>

In this case, repiping your house is needed due to the fact that not only are your pipes old, however your water quality is affected as well.</p>
