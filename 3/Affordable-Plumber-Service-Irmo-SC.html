<p>As an IMPORTANT SERVICES BUSINESS, we remain Readily available and open to help with any of your plumbing, drain, heating, air conditioning or electrical requirements.

Black iron pipes are durable, making them ideal for the transport of both natural and lp gas from the tank or the street to a home. Black iron also has a high heat resistance.</p>
<p>The person who does the testing needs to be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not needed to get this certification. I've checked with a few plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing ranged from $150 - $250, but I would anticipate the cost to be significantly less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
