Diane Heether is a city resident of Belding and she is grateful for having a water softener installed in her home. It didn't just improve and make cleaning easier, however it helps reduce waste also. A backflow prevention assembly is a mechanical valve arrangement designed to prevent the reversal of the flow of water once it has gone through the valve.
