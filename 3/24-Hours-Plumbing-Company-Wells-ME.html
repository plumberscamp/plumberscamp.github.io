<p>Against this, there is some anecdotal proof that particular magnetic and electro-magnetic devices can be effective in avoiding scale formation in tough water supply. It is extremely hard to evaluate such claims, which are nearly never based upon tests that are well sufficient described to allow others to assess them and to verify the outcomes.

<p>Aside from these 2 crucial parts, there are a myriad of little, maybe less critical things that can degrade or break. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away far more rapidly. Consistent gross smells coming from the toilet can indicate you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. You may need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising appropriately. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. Tank covers can break and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed if mishandled. While this will not affect the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by discussing all the important things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a total component and every part requires to be in excellent shape for it to operate at its best.</p>
