<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Tired of False Promises? Water flows in the tank where small resin beads switch the calcium and magnesium in the water for the salt or potassium they're holding.

During this process, the resin beads are washed with the extremely concentrated saltwater solution (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you contributed to the tank).
