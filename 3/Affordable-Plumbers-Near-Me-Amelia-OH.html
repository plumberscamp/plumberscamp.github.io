It's so old that it is no longer able to push water through the toilet to completely clear the drain. This results in your toilet having a consistent blocking problem.</p>
<p>If you hear water running in your toilet and you believe a leaky toilet tank or toilet bowl, attempt this: squirt a couple of drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and let the toilet sit for about half an hour. After 30 minutes, inspect to see if any of the water in your toilet bowl has altered color. If it has, you probably have a leak.</p>
<p>Lots of house owners will use a store-bought chemical drain cleaner to solve their clogged or filthy drain problems. These chemicals are simple to utilize and economical, however they damage your pipes and their impacts are just short term. Store-bought liquid drain cleaners use extreme chemicals to eat away at the clog and with repeated use, these chemicals will also gnaw at the pipe developing weak spots that are prone to burst. This is why professional drain cleaning from a drain cleaning company is always suggested.</p>
<p>Clear the trap: If the above techniques do not work, the next action would be to remove the P-trap under the sink. Place a pail beneath the area to catch water then loosen the two threaded caps that hold the curved area of the pipe in place. Nowadays, most kitchen drains are made of white PVC pipe with connections that can be unscrewed by hand.</p>
