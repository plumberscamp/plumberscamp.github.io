<h3>Some of the Best Tips for Dealing With Drain Problems in Norwich NY 13815</h3>
<p>Backflow indicates the unwanted reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable water system; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from taking place. Points at which a potable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, however they must be carefully created and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
