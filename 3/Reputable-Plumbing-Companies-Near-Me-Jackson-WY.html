<p>In some households, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to technique when looking for a viable service, particularly when simple plunging doesn't seem to work. However, there are lots of downsides to utilizing these hazardous products - not least of which is that they normally consist of compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing an obstruction, which can range from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, little things, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of presenting the danger of harm to your home and household.</p>
