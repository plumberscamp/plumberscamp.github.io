<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in potable water supply pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
